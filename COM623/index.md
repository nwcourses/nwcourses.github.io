# Course Overview

Hello, and welcome to Contemporary Web Applications.

## Credits ##

These notes were originally prepared by the module's author and original tutor, Joe Appleton, but have been modified by myself (NW).

## Technologies we will be using:

- **React**: React is currently the most popular JavaScript framework. React developers are in high demand. Demand and money aside, React is an incredibly powerful framework and a joy to work with.
- **Next.js**
- **Firebase**: You will learn how to implement your work on a serverless infrastructure. We will be using the latest cloud database from Google's Firebase cloud platform. You will also learn how to deploy your work on the Firebase serverless infrastructure.

## How you will be assessed

There are two assessments that will allow me to gauge how well you have done.

- **1.Analysis and design Report**
- **2.Implementation with accompanying Report**

These are on SOL.

## Topics

Provisional, subject to change.
