<h1 id="week1basicdatastructures">Week 1 - Basic Data Structures</h1>
<p>This week we will be looking at some basic <em>data structures</em>, the array, the linked list and the stack, and looking at their relevance.</p>
<h2 id="theimportanceofdatastructures">The importance of data structures</h2>
<p>We will start with a look at <em>data structures</em>. First of all, what is a data structure and why is it important? When it comes to programming, we frequently need to deal with <em>collections of data</em>, rather than a single item of data. For example, we might write a program to manage student records. This program would need to deal with not just one student, but <em>many</em> students. Similarly, you might want to write a program for a live music venue, to allow the venue to store concerts and allow users to book tickets. Again, such a program would have to deal with <em>many</em> concerts and <em>many</em> users.</p>
<p>To store multiple items in a computer program, we need to choose an appropriate <em>data structure</em>. A data structure is a programming construct which allows us to store multiple items. When dealing with data structures, an important thing to consider is <em>which is the most appropriate data structure for the problem we are trying to solve</em>? Certain data structures are more suited to specific types of problem, and we will be looking at this through the module.</p>
<h2 id="abasicdatastructurethearray">A basic data structure - the array</h2>
<p>Let's start with the most basic data structure of all, the <em>array</em>. An array is a data structure which can hold more than one item of data, and can be thought of as a series of "boxes" which can hold data. With an array, the key thing is that <em>each box is adjacent to its neighbours in memory</em> which has some consequences in terms of efficiency which we will consider as we go on</p>
<p>The diagram below shows an example of an array which holds the names of five items of fruit. </p>
<p><img src="../images/arrays.png" alt="An array"></p>
<p>The things to note here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays have <em>indices</em>. An <em>index</em> is a number which represents the <em>position</em> of an item in an array. In most programming languages, including Python, indices begin with <em>zero</em>. So the first item in the array has the index zero.</li>
<li>The items in an array are stored <em>continuously in the computer's memory</em> and <em>each item in the array uses the same amount of memory</em>. Here we assume that each item uses 64 bytes, so that the first item is stored at memory address 512, the second at memory address 576 and so on. This has some important consequences for performance of arrays versus other data structures, to be considered later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arrays do have some disadvantages. Their simplicity makes them easy to work with but this simplicity can lead to limitations.</p>

<p>You are writing a program to store employees for a company. It's a small company, with only 10 employees, shown above.</p>
<div class='questions'></div>
</div>

<div class='content-protected' data-depends='1'>
<ul>
<li>Kate Stevenson is the fourth member of the array, so would have index 3 (because indices start from zero). Mike Watson is the eighth member, so by the same logic, would have index 7.</li>
<li>The memory address of the start of the array is 1600, and each item uses up 80 bytes. There are three members before Kate Stevenson, so these three members would use up 80*3 = 240 bytes. Therefore, Kate Stevenson will be 240 bytes on from the start of the array, i.e. at memory address 1600+240 = <strong>1840</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advantagesanddisadvantagesofarrays">Advantages and disadvantages of arrays</h2>
<h3 id="advantagefastlookup">Advantage: Fast lookup</h3>
<p>As we saw above, the advantage of using an array is that it is very fast to <em>index</em> an array. This is because arrays are always <em>sequentially stored in memory</em>, so that in the example above, "apple", "orange", "pear", "grape" and "cherry" will be stored adjacent to each other in memory.</p>
<p>When indexing an array, the computer is able to work out where in memory the
data is stored, <strong>because each member of an array uses up the same number of bytes</strong>. The equation is simply:</p>
<pre><code>Address = Start Address + Index * Size Of One Member
</code></pre>
<p>So imagine, for example, that each member of an array uses up 32 bytes, and the start of the array is at memory location 24576. It's an easy
calculation to work out where the member with the index of 3 is located. If
we substitute the values into the equation we get:</p>
<pre><code>Address = 24576 + 3 * 32
</code></pre>
<p>which is <code>24576 + 96</code>, which is <code>24672</code>.</p>
<p>We ourselves do <em>not</em> need to do this calculation. The <em>computer</em> does it. But
we can see, because it's simple arithmetic, the computer is able to do it
very quickly. So, <strong>arrays are optimised for fast look-up of data using a 
numerical index</strong>.</p>
<h3>Creating a simple program making use of an array</h3>
<p>Here is a program which makes use of an array. We are creating an array called <code>people</code> to hold the names of members of a team.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
import numpy as np
fruits = np.array(['Apple', 'Orange', 'Cherry']) 

print("The first fruit is " + fruits[0])
print("The second fruit is " + fruits[1])
print("The third fruit is " + fruits[2])

</code></pre>
<p>Note a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>To use an array we use the <a href='https://numpy.org'>NumPy</a> library, which provides a range of features for scientific computing. However our use of NumPy here will simply be to create an array.</li>
<li>We define the array using the statement:
<pre>fruits = np.array(['Apple', 'Orange', 'Cherry'])</pre>
Note the square brackets surrounding the list of items to go in the array.
</li>
<li>Note the code to print the members of the array: 
<pre>print("The first fruit is " + fruits[0])
print("The second fruit is " + fruits[1])
print("The third fruit is " + fruits[2])</pre>
This code shows the use an array <em>index</em> to access each member of the array. The index is the number within the square brackets: 0 for the first member, 1 for the second and 2 for the third. Remember we discussed array indices above.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Coding exercise 1.1</h3>
<p>Write a program which creates an array with the 10 employees mentioned in Exercise 1. Display "Jane Smith" and "Mike Watson" by indexing the array appropriately.</p>
</div>

<div class='content-exercise' data-id='2'>
<div class='questions'></div>
</div>

<div class='content-protected' data-depends='2'>
<h3 id="disadvantagenotflexibleanarraycannotberesized">Disadvantage: not flexible, an array cannot be resized</h3>
<p>Now, imagine you want to add two more entries to the array:</p>
<pre>employees[10] = "Kevin Kennedy"
employees[11] = "Lisa Lord"</pre>
<p>Now run it. Do you get the result that you expected? See how this illustrates an issue with arrays: they have <em>fixed size</em>. If an array is initialised with a certain number of elements, you cannot add additional elements later and the only valid indices are those indices within the capacity of the array. Here, the array was initialised with 10 elements so only indices 0-9 are valid. Furthermore attempting to append to the end of the array via an <code>append</code> operation would not work either:</p>
<pre>employees.append("Kevin Kennedy")</pre>
<h4>Not enough space, or too much space!</h4>
<p>Imagine we have a larger array storing company employees, as shown in the diagram below. (Just the initials of the employees are shown).</p>
<p><img src="../images/employee_array.png" alt="Employee array"></p>
<p>Let's say, though, the company takes on an 11th employee, "Ulysses Vernon" (UV). Do we have space in the array to fit this 11th employee? <em>No, we don't, because an array has fixed size!</em></p>
<p>So <strong>what happens if the company expands and takes on more employees</strong>? What could we do? </p>
<p><img src="../images/array_problems.png" alt="Adding to an array"></p>
<ul>
<li>As shown in the diagram above, we could <em>make the array bigger than we are likely to ever need</em>, so we can add new employees. So we could create an array with 30 spaces, and add our 10 original employees to it. Then, there would be room for the 11th employee (and quite a few more, too). <em>Can you see the problem with this, though</em>? The <em>storage is inefficient</em> as the array has many more spaces than we are likely to need and therefore it is <em>wasteful of memory</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using a List</h2>
<p>One solution is to use a more complex data structure, which can be extended with new data. In fact Python uses one such data structure, the <em>list</em>.  A list is essentially a wrapper round an underlying array. With the list you can add new items of data to the end of the list using the <code>append</code> operation, and keep doing so until the computer runs out of memory. </p>
<p>Other languages have similar "extensible array" data structures, for instance C++ has the <code>vector</code> and Java has the <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>
<h3>Creating a simple program making use of a list</h3>
<p>Here is a program which makes use of a list. We are creating a list called <code>people</code> to hold the names of members of a team. The list initially has space for three members, however we can later append to it, to expand the list.
</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
print("Please enter the three people in your team")
people = [None] * 3
people[0] = input("Please enter the first person:")
people[1] = input("Please enter the second person:")
people[2] = input("Please enter the third person:")

print("The first person is " + people[0])
print("The second person is " + people[1])
print("The third person is " + people[2])

fourth = input("Please enter the fourth person:")
fifth = input("Please enter the fourth person:")
people.append(fourth)
people.append(fifth)
print("The fourth person is " + people[3])
print("The fifth person is " + people[4])

</code></pre>
<p>Note a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We define the list using the statement:
<pre>people = [None] * 3</pre>
<code>*</code> is the <em>multiplication symbol</em> in most programming languages. This will create a list with three blank members (i.e. <code>None</code> times 3; <code>None</code> basically means "nothing here yet").</li>
<li>Note the code: <code>people[0]</code>. This is using an <em>index</em> - remember we discussed indices above. Specifically this code is retrieving the member of the list with index zero.</li>
<li>Note also how we can <em>append</em> to the list: unlike an array, we can extend it after we created it so we are not restricted to the original size.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Coding Exercise 1.2</h3>
<p>Rewrite your exercise 1.1 code to use a list rather than an array. Try appending to it using <em>append()</em>. Does it work?</p>
</div>

<div class='content-exercise' data-id='3' data-depends='2'>
<h3>How does a list work under the hood?</h3>
<p>We have looked at how to use a list. However we are now going to look at what actually happens when a list is appended to, via an interactive exercise.</p>
<div class='questions'></div>
</div>

<div class='content-protected' data-depends='3'>
<p>Lists contain an internal array. So what happens when we need to extend a list? We <em>create a new array with more space</em> when the old one runs out of space. We need to: 
<ul>
<li>Create an array of the new, larger, size (large enough to hold all the new members we're trying to add);</li>
<li>Copy all the existing members into the new array;</li>
<li>Add the new members onto the end of the array.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is shown below. This diagram shows a <em>simplified</em> version of what happens when you append to a list. It is a repeat of the diagram showing array resizing, but also shows the <em>list</em> (in green) as a wrapper round the array. It shows how the internal array has to be recreated and the old data copied across when you append to a list.</p>
<p><img src="../images/list.png" alt="Appending to a list"></p>
</div>

<div class='content-exercise' data-id='4' data-depends='3'>
<div class='questions'></div>
</div>


<div class='content-protected' data-depends='4'>
<p>This however is <em>inefficient</em> because  a new internal array is created with additional space to hold the new elements, and then the old data is copied across from the old array to the new array. We have to loop through each element in the old array and copy it across to the new array, which is <em>slow</em></p>
<p>(The Python list does however include some optimisations to improve the efficiency of append and insertion operations. For instance, more memory is allocated for the internal array than is needed, meaning that a new internal array need not be created if only a small number of items are added as there will be spare space at the end of the array to hold them. See <a href="https://www.laurentluce.com/posts/python-list-implementation/">here</a> for details.)</p>
</div>

<div class='content-public'>
<h2 id="thelinkedlist">The linked list</h2>
<p>We will start with a look at <em>linked lists</em>. Linked lists, which are <em>different to the plain <strong>list</strong>s we discussed above</em>, are unlike arrays
in that they are <em>not</em> stored continuously in memory. Instead, data is stored
as a series of linked <em>nodes</em>. Each node contains one item of data, and links
to the memory locations of the previous and the next item of data in the 
linked list.</p>
<p><img src="images/linkedlist.png" alt="Linked list diagram"></p>
<p>Each node has a link to the previous and the following node. When we add
a new item of data, we make the previous node link to the new node, and
we link the new node back to the previous node to form a two-way link.</p>
<p>The first node in the list links to nothing in the reverse direction (indicated in Python by the special value <code>None</code>) and similarly, the final node in the list links to nothing in the forward direction.</p>
</div>

<div class='content-exercise' data-id='5'>
<p>We will now think about the consequences of this.</p>
<div class='questions'></div>
</div>

<div class='content-protected' data-depends='5'>
<ul>
<li><p>Remember how we could use simple arithmetic, using the array index, to 
calculate the location in memory of a given element in an array. Can
we do this here? <strong>We cannot. This is because, in a linked list, items are not 
stored continuously in memory. Instead, each node contains references to the 
memory locations of the previous and the following node.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, <strong>as long as we have a reference to both the start and the end of the linked list, it's efficient to add a new member to the end of the linked list</strong>. We can just create a new node and link it, both ways, to the end node. Contrast this to arrays, in which we had to create a new array with additional space and copy the elements over. We will explore this in more detail in the exercises this week.</p></li>
<li><p>Insertion into the <em>middle</em> of the list has mixed efficiency. On the one hand we have to find the index we want to insert the element at (which as we saw above is inefficient), on the other hand the actual insertion process is easier as we can just break the existing links between the node BEFORE the element we want to insert and the node AFTER this element, and then link in the new element.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thestack">The stack</h2>
<p>A stack data structure involves adding items from bottom to top, rather like a
stack of plates. When we remove items from the stack, we remove from the top,
again just like a stack of plates.
The stack is known as a "last in first out" or "LIFO" data structure.
It is called this, because the last things we add to the stack, are the
first things we remove. Here is an example of a simple stack of numbers.</p>
<p><img src="../images/stack.png" alt="Simple stack"></p>
<p>A stack can be used for any operation in which we need to navigate back to
a previous state. Examples could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Browser navigation. When we visit a website, we often need to navigate back to a previous site. When we click the 'Back' button, we want to return to the site <em>immediately preceding</em> the one we are currently viewing. So when you click 'Back', the current site might be <em>removed from the stack</em> so that you return to the previous site.</p></li>
<li><p>Directory/folder structure. When navigating the folder system of your computer, you typically start at a 'root' folder (for example <code>C:\</code> on Windows, or your home directory on Linux) and then navigate to subfolders, for example <code>C:\Pictures</code>. You then might navigate to a sub-sub-folder, such as <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday</code> and then <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday\2018</code> and so on. In a subfolder you can navigate upwards to the previous folder, so that if you are in <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday</code> and you navigate upwards, you arrive at <code>C:\Pictures</code> and then <code>C:\</code> if you navigate upwards once more. So the process of navigating upwards <em>removes the current folder from the stack</em> and returns to the previous folder.</p></li>
<li><p>"Undo" commands in desktop applications. Each action you take in a desktop application might be stored on a stack, so that if you select "Undo", the topmost operation would be reversed, and then removed from the stack.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(In actual fact, each of these is now implemented in a slightly more complex way, in the sense that you can, in modern browsers, move both back and forwards along your history, but we are assuming a more simplified implementation in which you can only move back for the purposes of illustrating a stack).</p>
<p>Another use of stacks, which you will appreciate more when you have done more programming, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing function calls in a program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two key operations of a stack, adding and removing items, have special
terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Push</strong>. To <em>push</em> an item onto a stack means to add it to the top.
It is possible the stack may only have a certain capacity, i.e. it can only hold
a certain number of items (perhaps due to memory constraints) in which case an error occurs if the stack is full.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pop</strong>. To <em>pop</em> an item off the stack means to remove it from the top.
The item is removed, and we also obtain it as a result of the pop operation.
If the stack is empty, an error is generated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional operation is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peek</strong>, To <em>peek</em> a stack is to obtain the value of the top-most item of the stack <em>without</em> removing it.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class='content-public'>
<h3>Paper Exercise 1.3 : Stacks</h3>
<p>We are now going to perform another paper-based exercise with stacks, to help
you understand them and their operations.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an empty stack. Draw the stack after each operation
below, and explain what, if anything is returned from each operation and
any errors that might occur.</p>

<p><code>push (a), push (b), pop (), push (c), peek (), pop (), pop (), pop (), push (d), push (e), push (f), pop (), push (g), push (h), peek (), push (i), pop (), pop (), pop (), peek ().</code></p>
