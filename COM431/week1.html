<h1 id="week1basicdatastructures">Week 1 - Basic Data Structures</h1>
<p>This week we will be looking at some basic <em>data structures</em>, the array, the linked list and the stack, and looking at their relevance.</p>
<h2 id="theimportanceofdatastructures">The importance of data structures</h2>
<p>We will start with a look at <em>data structures</em>. First of all, what is a data structure and why is it important? When it comes to programming, we frequently need to deal with <em>collections of data</em>, rather than a single item of data. For example, we might write a program to manage student records. This program would need to deal with not just one student, but <em>many</em> students. Similarly, you might want to write a program for a live music venue, to allow the venue to store concerts and allow users to book tickets. Again, such a program would have to deal with <em>many</em> concerts and <em>many</em> users.</p>
<p>To store multiple items in a computer program, we need to choose an appropriate <em>data structure</em>. A data structure is a programming construct which allows us to store multiple items. When dealing with data structures, an important thing to consider is <em>which is the most appropriate data structure for the problem we are trying to solve</em>? Certain data structures are more suited to specific types of problem, and we will be looking at this through the module.</p>
<h2 id="abasicdatastructurethearray">A basic data structure - the array</h2>
<p>Let's start with the most basic data structure of all, the <em>array</em>. An array is a data structure which can hold more than one item of data, and can be thought of as a series of "boxes" which can hold data. With an array, the key thing is that <em>each box is adjacent to its neighbours in memory</em> which has some consequences in terms of efficiency which we will consider as we go on</p>
<p>The diagram below shows an example of an array which holds the names of five items of fruit. </p>
<p><img src="../images/arrays.png" alt="An array"></p>
<p>The things to note here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays have <em>indices</em>. An <em>index</em> is a number which represents the <em>position</em> of an item in an array. In most programming languages, including Python, indices begin with <em>zero</em>. So the first item in the array has the index zero.</li>
<li>The items in an array are stored <em>continuously in the computer's memory</em> and <em>each item in the array uses the same amount of memory</em>. Here we assume that each item uses 64 bytes, so that the first item is stored at memory address 512, the second at memory address 576 and so on. This has some important consequences for performance of arrays versus other data structures, to be considered later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arrays do have some disadvantages. Their simplicity makes them easy to work with but this simplicity can lead to limitations. </p>
<h2 id="advantagesanddisadvantagesofarrays">Advantages and disadvantages of arrays</h2>
<h3 id="advantagefastlookup">Advantage: Fast lookup</h3>
<p>As we saw above, the advantage of using an array is that it is very fast to <em>index</em> an array. This is because arrays are always <em>sequentially stored in memory</em>, so that in the example above, "apple", "orange", "pear", "grape" and "cherry" will be stored adjacent to each other in memory.</p>
<p>When indexing an array, the computer is able to work out where in memory the
data is stored, <strong>because each member of an array uses up the same number of bytes</strong>. The equation is simply:</p>
<pre><code>Address = Start Address + Index * Size Of One Member
</code></pre>
<p>So imagine, for example, that each member of an array uses up 32 bytes, and the start of the array is at memory location 24576. It's an easy
calculation to work out where the member with the index of 3 is located. If
we substitute the values into the equation we get:</p>
<pre><code>Address = 24576 + 3 * 32
</code></pre>
<p>which is <code>24576 + 96</code>, which is <code>24672</code>.</p>
<p>We ourselves do <em>not</em> need to do this calculation. The <em>computer</em> does it. But
we can see, because it's simple arithmetic, the computer is able to do it
very quickly. So, <strong>arrays are optimised for fast look-up of data using a 
numerical index</strong>.</p>
<h3>Creating a simple program making use of an array</h3>
<p>Here is a program which makes use of an array (it's actually, technically, something called a <em>list</em>, which you will be introduced to below, but for simplicity we're going to assume it's an array). We are creating an array called <code>people</code> to hold the names of members of a team.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
import numpy as np
fruits = np.array(['Apple', 'Orange', 'Cherry']) 

print("The first fruit is " + fruits[0])
print("The second fruit is " + fruits[1])
print("The third fruit is " + fruits[2])

</code></pre>
<p>Note a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>To use an array we use the <a href='https://numpy.org'>NumPy</a> library, which provides a range of features for scientific computing. However our use of NumPy here will simply be to create an array.</li>
<li>We define the array using the statement:
<pre>fruits = np.array(['Apple', 'Orange', 'Cherry'])</pre>
Note the square brackets surrounding the list of items to go in the array.
</li>
<li>Note the code to print the members of the array: 
<pre>print("The first fruit is " + fruits[0])
print("The second fruit is " + fruits[1])
print("The third fruit is " + fruits[2])</pre>
This code showss the use an array <em>index</em> to access each member of the array. The index is the number within the square brackets: 0 for the first member, 1 for the second and 2 for the third. Remember we discussed array indices above.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Try running this code but <em>before you do so</em>, try to predict what will be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="disadvantagenotflexibleanarraycannotberesized">Disadvantage: not flexible, an array cannot be resized</h3>
<p>Now, imagine you want to add two more entries to the array:</p>
<pre>fruits[3] = "Banana"
fruits[4] = "Pear"</pre>
<p>Now run it. Do you get the result that you expected? See how this illustrates an issue with arrays: they have <em>fixed size</em>. If an array is initialised with a certain number of elements, you cannot add additional elements later and the only valid indices are those indices within the capacity of the array. Here, the array was initialised with three elements so only indices 0, 1 and 2 are valid. Furthermore attempting to append to the end of the array via an <code>append</code> operation would not work either:</p>
<pre>fruits.append("Grape")</pre>
<h4>Not enough space, or too much space!</h4>
<p>Imagine we have a larger array storing company employees, as shown in the diagram below. (Just the initials of the employees are shown).</p>
<p><img src="../images/employee_array.png" alt="Employee array"></p>
<p>Let's say, though, the company takes on an 11th employee, "Ulysses Vernon" (UV). Do we have space in the array to fit this 11th employee? <em>No, we don't, because an array has fixed size!</em></p>
<p>So <strong>what happens if the company expands and takes on more employees</strong>? What could we do? </p>
<p><img src="../images/array_problems.png" alt="Adding to an array"></p>
<ul>
<li>As shown in the diagram above, we could <em>make the array bigger than we are likely to ever need</em>, so we can add new employees. So we could create an array with 30 spaces, and add our 10 original employees to it. Then, there would be room for the 11th employee (and quite a few more, too). <em>Can you see the problem with this, though</em>? The <em>storage is inefficient</em> as the array has many more spaces than we are likely to need and therefore it is <em>wasteful of memory</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using a List</h2>
<p>One solution is to use a more complex data structure, which can be extended with new data. In fact Python uses one such data structure, the <em>list</em>.  A list is essentially a wrapper round an underlying array. With the list you can add new items of data to the end of the list using the <code>append</code> operation, and keep doing so until the computer runs out of memory. </p>
<p>Other languages have similar "extensible array" data structures, for instance C++ has the <code>vector</code> and Java has the <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>
<h3>Creating a simple program making use of a list</h3>
<p>Here is a program which makes use of a list. We are creating a list called <code>people</code> to hold the names of members of a team. The list initially has space for three members, however we can later append to it, to expand the list.
</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">
print("Please enter the three people in your team")
people = [None] * 3
people[0] = input("Please enter the first person:")
people[1] = input("Please enter the second person:")
people[2] = input("Please enter the third person:")

print("The first person is " + people[0])
print("The second person is " + people[1])
print("The third person is " + people[2])

fourth = input("Please enter the fourth person:")
fifth = input("Please enter the fourth person:")
people.append(fourth)
people.append(fifth)
print("The fourth person is " + people[3])
print("The fifth person is " + people[4])

</code></pre>
<p>Note a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We define the list using the statement:
<pre>people = [None] * 3</pre>
<code>*</code> is the <em>multiplication symbol</em> in most programming languages. This will create a list with three blank members (i.e. <code>None</code> times 3; <code>None</code> basically means "nothing here yet").</li>
<li>Note the code: <code>people[0]</code>. This is using an <em>index</em> - remember we discussed indices above. Specifically this code is retrieving the member of the list with index zero.</li>
<li>Note also how we can <em>append</em> to the list: unlike an array, we can extend it after we created it so we are not restricted to the original size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try running this code but <em>before you do so</em>, try to predict what will be displayed.</p>
<h3>How does a list work under the hood?</h3>
<p>We have looked at how to use a list. However we are now going to look at what actually happens when a list is appended to, via an interactive exercise.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> A list actually uses a non-extensible array internally. Given this, what do you think might happen internally when we append to the list? How can we deal with the extra member, given that the internal array is of fixed size?</li>
<li>You will get the chance to think about this in class, and we will then go over the answer.</li>
<li>Once this is done, think about whether you can see any <em>efficiency problems</em> with the process of appending to a list.</li>
<li>You will again think about this for a few minutes, then we will discuss these efficiency problems.</li>
<li>Once we've done this exercise, notes will appear here, discussing the issues covered by the exercise.</li>
</ol>

<!--
<p>Lists contain an internal array. So what happens when we need to extend a list? We <em>create a new array with more space</em> hen the old one runs out of space. We need to: 
<ul>
<li>Create an array of the new, larger, size (large enough to hold all the new members we're trying to add);</li>
<li>Copy all the existing members into the new array;</li>
<li>Add the new members onto the end of the array.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is shown below. This diagram shows a <em>simplified</em> version of what happens when you append to a list. It is a repeat of the diagram showing array resizing, but also shows the <em>list</em> (in green) as a wrapper round the array. It shows how the internal array has to be recreated and the old data copied across when you append to a list.</p>
<p><img src="../images/list.png" alt="Appending to a list" /></p>
<p>This however is <em>inefficient</em> because  a new internal array is created with additional space to hold the new elements, and then the old data is copied across from the old array to the new array. We have to loop through each element in the old array and copy it across to the new array, which is <em>slow</em></p>
<p>(The Python list does however include some optimisations to improve the efficiency of append and insertion operations. For instance, more memory is allocated for the internal array than is needed, meaning that a new internal array need not be created if only a small number of items are added as there will be spare space at the end of the array to hold them. See <a href="https://www.laurentluce.com/posts/python-list-implementation/">here</a> for details.)</p>
<h3 id="furtherdisadvantageinsertiondifficult">Further disadvantage: insertion difficult</h3>
<p>Above we saw that <em>adding extra data to the end of a list</em> is inefficent, and we had to inefficiently <em>create a new array and copy the data across</em> if we wished to do that.Last week we saw that <em>adding extra data to the end of an array</em> was not possible, and we had to inefficiently <em>create a new array and copy the data across</em> if we wished to do that.  What if we wanted to add a new member at a <em>specific position</em> in the array?
For example, imagine we had an array of contacts that we wished to keep in 
alphabetical order, e.g:</p>
<pre><code>Alex Acland
Bonnie Black
Charley Chase
Earl Edwards
Frances Freeman
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine we had a new name, "Danielle Dawson" which we wanted to insert between "Charley Chase" and "Earl Edwards" in the array above. What could we do? <strong>Again we will consider this in class</strong>; the answers will appear here later.</p>
<p>What we would have to do is
<ul>
<li>Create a new array, with one more space than the original array;</li>
<li>Copy the existing elements over to the new array, leaving a space for the new member;</li>
<li>Add the new member to the appropriate space in the new array. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../images/array_insert.png" alt="Array Insertion" /></p>
<p>Clearly this is inefficient as we have to <em>create a new array</em>, which is expensive in memory usage, as we have to have the old and new arrays in memory at the same time. </p>
-->
<h2 id="thelinkedlist">The linked list</h2>
<p>We will start with a look at <em>linked lists</em>. Linked lists, which are <em>different to the plain <strong>list</strong>s we discussed above</em>, are unlike arrays
in that they are <em>not</em> stored continuously in memory. Instead, data is stored
as a series of linked <em>nodes</em>. Each node contains one item of data, and links
to the memory locations of the previous and the next item of data in the 
linked list.</p>
<p><img src="../images/linkedlist.png" alt="Linked list diagram"></p>
<p>Each node has a link to the previous and the following node. When we add
a new item of data, we make the previous node link to the new node, and
we link the new node back to the previous node to form a two-way link.</p>
<p>The first node in the list links to nothing in the reverse direction (indicated in Python by the special value <code>None</code>) and similarly, the final node in the list links to nothing in the forward direction.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of this? </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remember how we could use simple arithmetic, using the array index, to 
calculate the location in memory of a given element in an array. Can
we do this here? <strong>We cannot. This is because, in a linked list, items are not 
stored continuously in memory. Instead, each node contains references to the 
memory locations of the previous and the following node.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, <strong>as long as we have a reference to both the start and the end of the linked list, it's efficient to add a new member to the end of the linked list</strong>. We can just create a new node and link it, both ways, to the end node. Contrast this to arrays, in which we had to create a new array with additional space and copy the elements over. We will explore this in more detail in the exercises this week.</p></li>
<li><p>Insertion into the <em>middle</em> of the list has mixed efficiency. On the one hand we have to find the index we want to insert the element at (which as we saw above is inefficient), on the other hand the actual insertion process is easier as we can just break the existing links between the node BEFORE the element we want to insert and the node AFTER this element, and then link in the new element. Again we will look at this in the exercises.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thestack">The stack</h2>
<p>A stack data structure involves adding items from bottom to top, rather like a
stack of plates. When we remove items from the stack, we remove from the top,
again just like a stack of plates.
The stack is known as a "last in first out" or "LIFO" data structure.
It is called this, because the last things we add to the stack, are the
first things we remove. Here is an example of a simple stack of numbers.</p>
<p><img src="../images/stack.png" alt="Simple stack"></p>
<p>A stack can be used for any operation in which we need to navigate back to
a previous state. Examples could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Browser navigation. When we visit a website, we often need to navigate back to a previous site. When we click the 'Back' button, we want to return to the site <em>immediately preceding</em> the one we are currently viewing. So when you click 'Back', the current site might be <em>removed from the stack</em> so that you return to the previous site.</p></li>
<li><p>Directory/folder structure. When navigating the folder system of your computer, you typically start at a 'root' folder (for example <code>C:\</code> on Windows, or your home directory on Linux) and then navigate to subfolders, for example <code>C:\Pictures</code>. You then might navigate to a sub-sub-folder, such as <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday</code> and then <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday\2018</code> and so on. In a subfolder you can navigate upwards to the previous folder, so that if you are in <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday</code> and you navigate upwards, you arrive at <code>C:\Pictures</code> and then <code>C:\</code> if you navigate upwards once more. So the process of navigating upwards <em>removes the current folder from the stack</em> and returns to the previous folder.</p></li>
<li><p>"Undo" commands in desktop applications. Each action you take in a desktop application might be stored on a stack, so that if you select "Undo", the topmost operation would be reversed, and then removed from the stack.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(In actual fact, each of these is now implemented in a slightly more complex way, in the sense that you can, in modern browsers, move both back and forwards along your history, but we are assuming a more simplified implementation in which you can only move back for the purposes of illustrating a stack).</p>
<p>Another use of stacks, which you will appreciate more when you have done more programming, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing function calls in a program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two key operations of a stack, adding and removing items, have special
terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Push</strong>. To <em>push</em> an item onto a stack means to add it to the top.
It is possible the stack may only have a certain capacity, i.e. it can only hold
a certain number of items (perhaps due to memory constraints) in which case an error occurs if the stack is full.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pop</strong>. To <em>pop</em> an item off the stack means to remove it from the top.
The item is removed, and we also obtain it as a result of the pop operation.
If the stack is empty, an error is generated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional operation is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peek</strong>, To <em>peek</em> a stack is to obtain the value of the top-most item of the stack <em>without</em> removing it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<h3 id="exercise1arrayspaperbased">Exercise 1: Arrays: Paper-based</h3>
<p>You are writing a program to store employees for a company. It's a small company, with only 10 employees. Try drawing, on paper, an array containing these 10 
employees. Draw each name in each position in the array, similar to the 
diagram above containing an array of fruit.</p>
<pre><code>John Stevenson
Jane Smith
Tim Wilson
Kate Stevenson
Kate Palmer
Tom Eastman
Laura Green
Mike Watson
Sally Black
Mark Ramsey
</code></pre>
<p>Answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What would be the index of "Kate Stevenson" in this array? What about "Mike Watson"?</p></li>
<li><p>If each item in the array needs 80 bytes of memory, and the start of the array is at memory location 1600, what is the memory address of the array item storing <code>Kate Stevenson</code>?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise 2: Arrays (code): Creating a simple program making use of an array</h3>
<p>Write a program which creates an array with the 10 employees mentioned in Exercise 1. Display "Jane Smith" and "Mike Watson" by indexing the array appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="exercise3addingnewdatatoanarraypaper">Exercise 3: Adding new data to an array (paper)</h3>
<p>Do this exercise on paper. This is a similar example to that given in the lecture, and is designed to illustrate the problems with adding new data to an array.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a 4-member array containing the values "C++", "Java", "PHP" and "Python"</li>
<li>Draw a new, empty 6-member array with space for the two new values "JavaScript" and "Kotlin". However, do not add these yet.</li>
<li>Write a heading "Copying old array to new array". Under this heading.
draw the second array again, with the existing members "C++", "Java", "PHP" and "Python" inserted, leaving two spaces in the middle (the data is sorted in alphabetical order) for the two new entries. </li>
<li>Write a heading "Adding new members to new array". Under this heading, 
draw the second array with the new values "JavaScript" and "Kotlin" inserted into the two spaces in the array.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise4linkedlistpaper">Exercise 4 : Linked List (paper)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Think about what you would have to do to search for a particular
item in a linked list using its index, starting at the beginning. </p>
<p>Draw out a linked list containing the 5 items of data: </p>
<pre><code>- Linux 
- Windows 
- Mac OS X
- Android
- iOS
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine we wish to retrieve the item with index 3 (Android). How could we 
do this? Draw out how you think it could be done on paper, and ask yourself:
<strong>how efficient is this</strong>, particularly compared to doing the same thing with an array. </p></li>
<li>Imagine that we wish to add a new item (Solaris) to the end of the linked list. Draw a diagram showing the process of creating this new item and adding it to the linked list.</li>
</ol>
<!--
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Note how, to find a particular index within a linked list, we have to start at the beginning and follow the links until we arrive at the element we wish to access. This is slow compared to the simple address calculation from an index in an array.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Remember with an array, that we had problems if we wanted to add new data
to the array. We had to create a brand new array with more space, and copy the 
old data into the new array before adding the new data. Think about doing the
same thing with a linked list. On paper, draw a linked list containing the elements </p>
<pre><code>- Linux
- Windows
- Mac OS X
</code></pre>
<p>Now try and add new element "Android" to the end of the linked list. What do you have to do? Draw out what happens on paper.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="solution-1">Solution</h4>
<p>Note how it's easy to add a new element to the end of a linked list. We just need to link it with the current last element, and then update the last element to point to the new element. Compare this with the need to create a new array, and copy the old elements over, if we wish to add elements to an array.</p>
-->
<h3 id="exercise5stacks">Exercise 5: Stacks</h3>
<p>We are now going to perform another paper-based exercise with stacks, to help
you understand them and their operations.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an empty stack. Draw the stack after each operation
below, and explain what, if anything is returned from each operation and
any errors that might occur.</p>
<p><code>push (a), push (b), pop (), push (c), peek (), pop (), pop (), pop (), push (d), push (e), push (f), pop (), push (g), push (h), peek (), push (i), pop (), pop (), pop (), peek ().</code></p>
<h3 id="exercise6linkedlistinsertion">Exercise 6: Linked list insertion</h3>
<p>Think about adding a new item of data into the middle of a linked list. Consider this ordered list of names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Acland</li>
<li>Bonnie Black</li>
<li>Charley Chase</li>
<li>Earl Edwards</li>
<li>Frances Freeman</li>
</ul>
<p>On paper draw these as a linked list. Now try to add "Danielle Dawson" at the appropriate place between "Charley Chase" and "Earl Edwards". What operations need to be done now? Draw them on paper again. Do you think this would be more or less efficient than using an array? </p>
<!--
<h4 id="solution-2">Solution</h4>
<p>Note the mixed efficiency when inserting into the middle of the linked list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>on the one hand, we have to search for the name to insert after (i.e. "Charley Chase"). As we have seen above, this is less efficient than arrays if we are searching by index (2 for "Charley Chase"). But if we are searching by name instead, we have to compare each record with the search term ("Charley Chase" here) by starting at the beginning of the data structure and comparing each item in turn to the search term. This is the same process whether we use an array or a linked list, so the efficiency is similar in either case.</p></li>
<li><p>on the other hand, the actual insertion process is <em>more</em> efficient, as we just have to break the links between Charley Chase and Earl Edwards, and create new links between each and Danielle Dawson. This is more efficient than an array, in which we would have to create a new array with one extra space and copy the old items over once again.</p></li>
</ul>
