<h2 id="warning">Warning!</h2>
<p>This is a more advanced topic which is not compulsory for passing the
assignment, but might be useful for higher marks. It's included here to give 
those of you who are coping reasonably well with the module an idea on how more advanced and efficient sorting algorithms work.</p>
<p>If you need to catch up with previous weeks, please do this first!</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Two weeks ago we covered some basic sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort. However, we saw that their efficiency could be better, being <code>O(n^2)</code> in the worst case. This week we will look at two improved sorting algorithms, <em>quicksort</em> and <em>merge sort</em>.</p>
<p>These algorithms use <em>recursion</em>. Please see <a href="trees1.html">the trees topic</a> for a reminder on recursion.</p>
<h2 id="quicksort">Quicksort</h2>
<p>Quicksort is the first of the two algorithms. It works by recursively <em>partitioning</em> the list into two sections, or <em>partitions</em>, either side of an element we call the <em>pivot</em>. </p>
<p>An arbitrary element (e.g. the last, the middle, or the first) is picked as the pivot, and then the <em>partitioning phase</em> begins. The aim of the partitioning phase is to rearrange the list so that it all the elements less than the pivot element are to its left, and all elements greater than the pivot element are to its right. To do this, the partitioning phase re-arranges the list, performing a series of swaps so it is ordered correctly.</p>
<p>The general procedure is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../images/qsort1.png" alt="Quicksort - high level overview" /></p>
<p>Next stage is to recursively perform the quicksort again on the partition <em>before</em> the pivot, and the partition <em>after</em> the pivot - as the elements in each partition will not be sorted yet, all we know is that the pivot is in the correct place. Each partition will have the algorithm applied to it (so that each parititon will have its own pivot, and the partition will be sorted into the sub-partition less than the partition's pivot, the partition's pivot, and the sub-partition greater than the pivot).</p>
<p>The procedure continues until the entire list is sorted.</p>
<p>This is a very high level overview and the implementation details are not obvious at this stage. We have to consider the <em>partitioning</em> stage (working out which elements are less than, and which greater than, the pivot) in more detail. There are various approaches to this; we will use the Hoare partitioning algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="thehoarepartitioningalgorithm">The Hoare partitioning algorithm</h3>
<p>Described on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Wikipedia</a> and cross-checked against various academic sources including this one from <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/tony-hoare/quicksort.html#algorithm">Stanford University</a>.</p>
<p>The Hoare algorithm (developed by Tony Hoare) works by having two "fingers" 
(<em>term "finger" from notes by Brian Dup√©e, which were in turn sourced from the site sorting-algorithms.com</em>)
pointing to the start of the list and end of the list. We move the first "finger", referenced by the variable <code>i</code> forwards and the second "finger", referenced by the variable <code>j</code>, backwards, until <code>i</code> points to something <strong>GREATER THAN OR EQUAL</strong> TO the pivot and <code>j</code> points to something <strong>LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO</strong> the pivot.</p>
<p>As we move each "finger" forward and back, we test whether any valuse need to be swapped. If the value at <code>i</code> is greater than the value at <code>j</code>, and <code>i</code> is still to the left of <code>j</code>, then we know that the values are in the wrong order and we swap them.</p>
<p>When <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> point to the same element (the pivot) or cross over (<code>j</code> is to the left of <code>i</code>), then we know that we have done all the swaps we can, because <code>i</code> will have scanned all values greater than the pivot which were to the left of the pivot (and have now been swapped), and <code>j</code> will have scanned all values less than the pivot which were to the right of the pivot (and have now been swapped).</p>
<p>We return the new partition point (which will be either <code>j</code> or <code>i</code> - often they will point to the same value) so we can continue the operation recursively.</p>
<p>The algorithm is shown on the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="../images/qsort2.png" alt="Quicksort - Hoare partitioning algorithm" /></p>
<p>The quicksort function then:</p>
<ul>
<li>gets a new pivot by calling the Hoare partitioning algorithm;</li>
<li>recursively calls quicksort on the section left of the pivot and section right of the pivot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The recursion will stop when we have a list section of length 1 as it cannot be partitioned.</p>
<p>Quicksort is rather difficult to figure out from scratch so I will present some Python-like pseudocode of the Hoare algorithm below. This can be found in multiple places on the web including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Wikipedia</a>; as always you should always double-check anything on Wikipedia against other sources to check it's accurate.</p>
<pre><code>function hoare_partition(data, start, end)
    Let i = start
    Let j = end
    Let pivot = midpoint of list # this is arbitrary

    While true # this will loop forever

        Increase i until we find a number equal to or greater than number at pivot position
        Decrease j until we find a number equal to or less than number at pivot position

        # At this point, the numbers pointed to by i and j will be in the 'wrong' 
        # part of the list, so swap them, unless i and j are equal or have crossed over, 
        # in which case we have finished this run

        # If i and j haven't crossed over yet, swap the numbers, 
        # otherwise return i or j to use for the next partitioning
</code></pre>
<h3>Progressive sorting of quicksort using recursion</h3>
<p>We have covered the Hoare algorithm for sub-partitioning a partition, however it may not be clear how the quicksort algorithm progresses as a whole. In order to implement quicksort,
we also need a "master" quicksort function which will recursively call itself in order to recursively sub-partition the list into smaller and smaller partitions.  This will take, as parameters, our list, together with indices for the start and end of the current partition. Initially these indices should be set to the start and end of the list. The "master" function should then:
<ul>
<li>If the partition has a length of at least 2 (and thus can be sub-partitioned):
<ul>
<li>use Hoare partitioning (by calling our Hoare partitioning function) to partition the list and find a pivot;</li>
<li>recursively call the "master" function passing in the partition <em>before</em> the pivot we found from Hoare, in order to sub-partition this section of the list;</li>
<li>recursively call the "master" function passing in the partition <em>after</em> the pivot, in order to sub-partition this section.</li></ul></li>
<li>Or, return immediately if the partition has a length of 1. We cannot sub-partition any further and the process stops; we return from the function and descend the recursion stack to the previous call.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The diagram below shows how, with each run of the Hoare partitioning algorithm, the list is progressively sorted into place. 
<ul>
<li>Note how we progressively partition the list into smaller and smaller sub-partitions. We first partition the entire list, by selecting one of the centre two elements (62) as the pivot and partitioning the list into those values less than 62 and those greater than 62.</li>
<li>We then end up with two sub-partitions, one consisting of the first 6 elements of the list (those values less than 62) and the second consisting of the final three elements (those values greater then 62). Furthermore, as a result of this partitioning, <strong>the value 62 has been sorted into place (in its correct place in the list)</strong></li>
<li>We repeat the process with the first of these two partitions (the first six elements) by selecting a new pivot (57) and sub-partitioning into those values less than 57 and those values greater than 57 (none). The value 57 has now been sorted into place.</li>
<li>We then end up with just one sub-partition as all the other numbers in the previous step were less than the last pivot (57). The new pivot is 4 as it's the midpoint. Again this will only produce one sub-partition as all numbers are greater than 4. 4 is sorted into place.</li>
<li>We then end up with the values 28, 14, 33 and 41 in the current subpartition. The new pivot is 33. This time we end up with two partitions: 28 and 14 (less than 33) and 41 (greater than 33). 33 is sorted into place.</li>
<li>The process repeats until all numbers are sorted.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="complexityofquicksort">Complexity of quicksort</h3>
<p>The complexity of quicksort can be as low as <code>O(n^2)</code> in unusual cases but on average <code>O(n log n)</code>(<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/quick-sort/a/analysis-of-quicksort">Khan Academy</a>). The maths behind calculating this complexity is quite advanced but is discussed at length in this article.</p>
<h2 id="mergesort">Merge sort</h2>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/merge-sort/a/overview-of-merge-sort">Khan Academy</a></p>
<p>Merge sort is another more advanced sort which continuously splits the list
into equal parts until single elements are produced. For example, a list of
length 8 would be split into two parts of length 4, then four parts of length
2, then eight single-item lists. Or, a list of length 10 would be split into
two parts of length 5, then each part would be split into two parts of length
2 and 3, then each length 2 part would be split into two parts of length 1
while the length 3 part would be split into one part of length 1 and another
of length 2, the latter of which would be split again. This is shown on the
diagram below; the split phase is shown by the stages using red lines.</p>
<p><img src="../images/mergesort.png" alt="Merge sort" /></p>
<p>Once a split has happened, the components are recombined in sorted order.
So a split of a 2-member part into two 1-member parts would be recombined
into a 2-member part, but in sorted order. If a 3-member part was split into
1-member parts and 2-member parts, these would be recombined into a 3-member
part, but again in sorted order. So the list gradually reassembles itself
into its full length, but this time in sorted order. This is shown on the
same diagram above; the merge phase is shown by the stages using blue lines.</p>
<p>How do we merge two parts so that they are
in sorted order? The algorithm is as below.
Also see <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/merge-sort/a/linear-time-merging">Khan Academy</a> for a detailed explanation.</p>
<pre><code>combine(listA, listB):

    Set counterA to 0
    Set counterB to 0

    sorted_list = []

    while counterA not beyond end of listA and counterB not beyond end of listB
        if listA[counterA] &lt; listB[counterB]
            Add listA[counterA] to sorted_list
            Increase counterA by 1

        else if listB[counterB] &lt; listA[counterA]
            Add listB[counterB] to sorted_list
            Increase counterB by 1

    # At this point we will have added all elements from ONE of the two lists
    # to the output list but not the other

    if counterA is not beyond end of list A
        Add all remaining elements from list A
    else if counterB is not beyond end of list B
        Add all remaining elements from list B

    Return sorted_list
</code></pre>
<p>Why does this work? Let's consider merging the two 2-member lists
[2 5] and [3 4]. A very important point is that <strong>when merging lists, we know
that the previous lists will already be sorted from the previous run of
the merge algorithm.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The while loop continues running until we reach the end of the shorter
list. Here, both lists are the same length anyway</li>
<li>The first time the loop runs, we compare the first members of each list
and add the <em>lowest</em> to the output list. Here, 2 is lower than 3, so we
add 2.</li>
<li>This will move the counter on one place for the first list, but keep it
the same place for the second list. This is what we want, as we no longer
need to consider the first member of the first list (as it's been placed in
our output list), but we do need to consider the first member of the second 
list.</li>
<li>So the second time the loop runs, we compare the second member of the first
list (5) with the first member of the second (3).  This time, it's the member
in the second list which is lowest, so we add it to the output list:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Output list = [2 3]
</code></pre>
<p>and move the counter for the second list on one place.</p>
<ul>
<li>The third time the loop runs, we compare the second member of the first list
(5) with the second member of the second list (4). Again, the member in the
second list is lower, so we add it to the output list:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Output list = [2 3 4]
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the counter for the second list will be beyond the end of the
second list, so the loop exits. However, we still have one member (5) to be
considered from the first list, so we add the remainder of the longer list
elements (5) to the output list. (It's possible the two lists would be of
unequal length, e.g. a 3-member list and a 2-member list; this last stage
would also ensure that all un-added members from the longer list would be added)</p>
<h3>Implementing merge sort</h3>
<p>You will need these functions:
    <ul>
    <li>A function to split the list into two.</li>
    <li>A function to merge the sublists in sorted order, as described above.</li>
    <li>A recursive "manager" function, describe below.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4 id="recursiveapproachtomergesort">Recursive approach to merge sort</h4>
<p>The entire merge sort algorithm is handled with a recursive "manager" function. This
recursive function takes a list to be split as a parameter, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splits the list into two by calling the split function.</li>
<li>Recursively call itself again on each half of the list, as long as the length of that half is greater than 1 (obviously a sublist of length 1 doesn't have to be split again!). Note that the "manager" function returns a sorted combined list as described below. To understand what happens here, imagine the current call of the manager function splits the list into subsections of one. These will be not be recursively split again but will be combined in sorted order. This call will then return a sorted list of two. This call will of course be recursively called by another copy of the manager function, so the sorted list of two will be combined with another sorted list (maybe of two again) to produce a sorted list of four. The previous copy of the manager function will then return a sorted list of four to the third copy down in the stack, which will combine two sorted lists of four into a sorted list of eight, and so on.</li>
<li>Merge the two sublists in sorted order, as described above.</li>
<li>Return the merged and sorted list as indicated in the recursion discussion above.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="complexityofmergesort">Complexity of merge sort</h3>
<p>The complexity of merge sort is <code>O(n log n)</code>. See <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/merge-sort/a/analysis-of-merge-sort">here</a> for a detailed explanation.</p>
<h3 id="exercisecode">Exercises</h3>
<p>Have a go at implementing quicksort in code.</p>
<p>If you finish that, have a go at implementing merge sort according to the description above. Hint: to split a list in two, use code such as the following:
</p>
<pre>
import math

def split_list(data):
    length = len(data)
    halfway = math.ceil(length/2) # ceil rounds up to nearest integer
    return ( data[:halfway], data[halfway:] )
</pre>
