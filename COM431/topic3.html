<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>From next week onwards we will move on to actually implementing some data structures in Python, starting with the stack and the linked list. However, in order to do this effectively and cleanly, you need to be familiar with <em>object-oriented programming</em>. You will be introduced to this topic in more depth in COM411 later, but I will introduce this week just enough object-oriented programming for you to be able to code your own data structures.</p>
<p>(Note that Python comes with an extensive range of built-in data structures, for example you can treat the standard <code>list</code> type as a stack and perform <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations, but we are going to build them from scratch, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how the various data structures work.)</p>
<h2>What is object-oriented programming? - A very quick summary</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming involves developing code by thinking about all the real-world entities that your program needs to handle (such as students, employees, or data structures such as linked lists and stacks) and writing code to represent each real-world entity. To do this, we need to create <em>classes</em> and <em>objects</em>.</p>
<h2>Classes and Objects</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html">the Python documentation</a> for classes and objects.</p>
<h3 id="whatisaclass">What is a class?</h3>
<p>(<strong>This is a simplified explanation. More depth will be provided in COM411.</strong>)</p>
<p>A <code>class</code> can be thought of as a complex data type. Classes provide a way to define our own custom data structures. For example, we could create a <code>Cat</code> class to represent a cat, a <code>Stack</code> class to represent a stack, or a <code>LinkedList</code> class to represent a linked list. Classes represent specific types of real-world entity, such as cats, stacks or students, and can be considered as a blueprint which define how that type of entity works.</p>
<h3 id="whatisanobject">What is an object?</h3>
<p>An object is a specific <strong>instance</strong> of a class, for example, a <em>specific</em> cat, stack or linked list. A class can be thought of as a blueprint, or specification, for how a particular data structure should work. However an object is a <em>specific example</em> of that data structure.</p>
<p>For example, each of the two cats in the photo below (Binnie and Clyde) could be represented in code with an object. One object for Binnie, and another for Clyde.</p>
<p><img src="images/cats_small.jpg" alt="Cats"></p>
<p>We could define a Cat <em>class</em> and then create many cat <em>objects</em>, reperesenting individual cats.</p>
<p>We could define a Stack <em>class</em>, and then create two Stack <em>objects</em>. One Stack object could be used in a web browser and contain your browsing history, whereas another could be used in a paint program and represent each drawing operation you do, allowing you to undo them.</p>
<p>Or, you could define a <code>LinkedList</code> class, and then have one <code>LinkedList</code> object to store students at a university, another to store courses, and yet another to store staff.</p>
<h3>Attributes and methods</h3>
<p>Classes and objects contain two key components: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Methods</strong>. A method represents something which objects of a particular class can <em>do</em>. For example a Cat might have <code>walk()</code> and <code>eat()</code> methods.</li> 
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>. An attribute represents an <em>item of data</em> associated with the class. For example, a Cat might have name and weight.</li>
</ul>

<div class='content-protected' data-depends='1'>
<ul>
<li>Attributes for a <code>Cat</code> would include any <em>properties</em> of the cat. So that could include colour, breed, and age.</li>
<li>Methods for a <code>Cat</code> would include any <em>actions</em> that the <code>Cat</code> can do. For example we could have <code>sleep</code>, <code>meow</code>, <code>jump</code> or <code>play</code> methods.</li>
<li>Methods for a <code>Stack</code> would be <em>actions</em> that we can perform on a stack. So that could include <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code> and <code>peek</code> methods.</li>
<li>Attributes for a <code>Stack</code> would be the properties of the stack. This could include the internal array (as that would be part of the stack) and the number of items currently pushed to the stack.</li>
<li>Similarly, a <code>Car</code> could have attributes including make, model, top speed, engine capacity and colour - and methods to start the engine, move, change gear, brake, stop the engine, etc.</li>
</ul>

<div class='questions'></div>
</div>

<div class='content-protected' data-depends='2'>
<p>To answer the question, you need to consider which of these are <em>a general type of real-world entity</em> and which are <em>a specific real-world entity</em>. Using this guidance we find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The following are classes: Popstar, Smartphone, Politician, Tree, Dog, City, Programming language</li> 
<li>The following are objects: Michael Jackson, Your own phone, Kamala Harris, A specific tree growing in the park, Rocky, Paris and Python.</li> 
</ul>

<h2 id="implementingacatusingaclass">Implementing a Cat using a class</h2>
<p>We will start with a simple class representing a cat. This should be saved in a separate file, containing only the class: <code>cat.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.weight = weight

    def eat(self):
        self.weight += 1
</code></pre>
<p>This code does not <em>create any actual cats</em>. It just creates a <em>class</em>, or a <em>blueprint</em> or <em>specification</em>, for what cats are and what they do. Note, in particular, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We define the class with the keyword <code>class</code> followed by the name of the class (<code>Cat</code> here). Note the colon and the indentation. The colon defines what is called a <em>code block</em>  - here, the definition of the class. Note how everything within that block is indented (This can be with a tab, or a given number of spaces - typically 4). The block ends as soon as the indentation ends. You should be learning about this in COM411 this week.</p></li>
<li><p>Note how we list each <em>method</em>. We use the keyword <code>def</code> to define a method. (You will do functions in COM411 next week; a method is essentially a function within a class).</p></li>
<li><p>Note how each method is itself a code block, so we use a colon and indent the code within the method.</p></li>
<li><p>Note how we define two methods. We have <code>eat()</code> to define one of the most fundamental actions of a cat. However we also have a second method, <code>__init__()</code>. What is this? It is a special <strong>initialisation method</strong>. It runs whenever an object of the class is first created, and can be used to initialise the object. Here, we are using it to initialise the three <em>attributes</em> of the cat, the <code>name</code> and the <code>weight</code> (see below for more detail).</p></li>
<li><p>Note how each method contains, as a parameter, the keyword <code>self</code>. What is this? It is a <em>reference to the current object that we're working with</em>. Remember from the discussion on objects, above, that we might have <em>multiple objects of a given class</em>, for example, multiple cats. <code>self</code> refers to <em>whichever object we are dealing with right now</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Going back to the <code>eat()</code> method, note that it contains the code:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="python language-python">self.weight += 1
</code></pre>
<p>What does this do? Remember that <code>self</code> is the current object, in other words the current cat. The operator <code>+=</code> increases a variable by one. So <code>self.weight += 1</code> will increase the weight of the current cat by one.</p>
<p>To create actual cats, we need to create <code>Cat</code> <em>objects</em>, as follows. This should be in a separate file, <code>main.py</code>. Note how we import the Cat class from <code>cat.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">from cat import Cat

cat1 = Cat("Binnie", 4)
cat2 = Cat("Clyde", 2)
cat1.eat()
cat2.eat()
print(cat1.weight)
print(cat2.weight)
</code></pre>
<p>This code creates <em>two specific cats</em>, <code>cat1</code> and <code>cat2</code>. The lines:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">cat1 = Cat("Binnie", 4)
cat2 = Cat("Clyde", 2)
</code></pre>
<p>actually create the two cats. In each case, the <em>initialisation method</em> <code>__init__()</code>, which we saw above, is called, and the data about that cat is passed into the object.</p>
<p>Next, we actually make the cats <em>do</em> something by calling <em>methods</em>. Firstly, we call the <code>eat()</code> method on each cat:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">cat1.eat()
cat2.eat()
</code></pre>
<p>We then print the <code>weight</code> of each cat, to show that eating has increased the weight by one:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">print(cat1.weight)
print(cat2.weight)
</code></pre>
<h3>Methods with Parameters</h3>
<pre><code class="python language-python">class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.weight = weight

    def eat(self, <em>amount</em>):
        self.weight += amount
</code></pre>
<p>In many cases, we need to <em>pass information in to a method</em> to tell it what to do. For example, it would be useful if we could tell the <code>eat()</code> how much food the cat needs to eat. We do this by specifying one or more <em>parameters</em> in the method, separated by commas. So:</p>
<pre>def eat(self, amount)</pre>
<p>includes a parameter <code>amount</code> specifying how much food the cat should eat. We then use that in our statement to increase the weight, by increasing it by <code>amount</code>:
</p>
<pre>self.weight += amount</pre>
<p>When calling the method, we then specify the parameter, e.g:</p>
<pre>
cat1 = Cat("Flathead", 4)
cat2 = Cat("Cupra", 3)
cat1.eat(<em>3</em>)
cat2.eat(<em>2</em>)
print(cat1.weight)
print(cat2.weight)
</pre>

<h3 id="exercise1">Coding Exercise 3.1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Try out this example. Save your Cat class in one file, <code>cat.py</code>. Add the code which creates two Cat objects and makes them eat (see above) into your <code>main.py</code> and import the Cat class into your <code>main.py</code> using:
<pre>from cat import Cat</pre>
Assuming your Cat class is in the file <code>cat.py</code>, this will import the Cat class into your <code>main.py</code>.</li>
<li>Once it's working, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Add some other attributes to the Cat class, which you think would be appropriate for a Cat class to have.</li>
<li>Add a <code>print()</code> method to display all the details of the Cat using a <code>print()</code> statement.</li>
<li>Create a <code>walk()</code> method inside the <code>Cat</code> class. This should reduce the cat's weight by one.</li>
<li>In the section of your code which creates the cats, create a third cat, "Old Tom" with weight 6, and print all three cats by calling their <code>print()</code> method. </li>
<li>Make Old Tom eat, and make all three cats walk after they have eaten. After walking, display all three cats' weight again, to show that walking reduces the weight by one.</li></ul></li>
<li>Using an <code>if</code> statement, change the <code>walk()</code> method so that the cat cannot walk if the weight is below 1. (The intention is to avoid starving the cat). </li>
</ol>
<h3>Coding Exercise 3.2: Additional object-oriented programming exercise</h3>
<p>Try out this additional exercise using classes and objects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a completely new class called <code>Student</code> to represent a student.
Pass the following as parameters to the <code>__init__()</code> method, and initialise the appropriate attributes.
	<ul>
	<li><code>id</code>, representing the student's ID</li>
	<li><code>name</code>, representing the student's name</li>
	<li><code>course</code>, representing the student's course</li>
	<li><code>mark</code>, the student's mark</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Give the <code>Student</code> class a <code>print()</code> method, which prints the student details.</li>
<li>Write some code to create 5 students within a <code>for</code> loop. Create a <code>Student</code> object each time the loop runs, using details the user entered from the keyboard using the <code>input</code> statement . Then, still within the loop, display each student by printing it.
</li>
<li>Add a <code>setMark()</code> method to your <code>Student</code> class, to set the student's mark. The method must validate the mark using an <code>if</code> statement, and check that it is between 0 and 100. The mark should only be updated if it is valid. Return a boolean to indicate whether the method was successful or not: it should return <code>True</code> if the mark was valid and <code>False</code> otherwise.</li>
<li>Add a <code>printGrade()</code> method to <code>Student</code>. This should  print the student's grade as a <em>string</em> based on the mark, according to this scheme :
    <ul>
    <li>70+ : First</li>
    <li>60-69 : 2/1</li>
    <li>50-59 : 2/2</li>
    <li>40-49 : Third</li>
    <li>0-39 : Fail</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Test out the previous question by modifying the loop so that you call the <code>printGrade()</code> method of each student you create.</li>
</ol>
