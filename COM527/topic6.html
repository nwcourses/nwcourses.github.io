<h1>MAD Topic 6: Android Permissions, GPS, ViewModel</h1> 
</div>
<h2>Android Runtime Permissions</h2>
<h3>Revision: The manifest file and Permissions</h3>
<p>Last week you were very briefly introduced to <em>permissions</em>. 
Apps need to be granted <em>permissions</em> to perform sensitive 
operations. Sensitive operations can include:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Using the internet</em> - because this might incur a cost to
    the user, and have potential privacy/security concerns;</li>
    <li><em>GPS for tracking your location</em> - because this could be potentially
    abused (e.g. by stalkers)</li>
    <li><em>Reading from and writing to files</em> - again this has
    security concerns.</li>    
    <li><em>Using the camera and microphone.</em></li>
    </ul>
The permissions an app needs are specified in the <em>AndroidManifest.xml</em> file, within the <em>manifests</em> directory, before the <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> tag. For example, to specify that we need internet permission, we
would add the line:
<pre>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;</pre>
</p>
<h3>The classic permissions model</h3>
<p>Before Android 6, permissions were specified at <em>install time</em>, so a user was informed what permissions an app needed when they installed the app.
However, this model had some disadvantages. It is not very flexible; a user might want to use <em>some</em> permissions but turn others off.  For example, if a user is installing a mapping app which allows the user to take photos, they might wish to use the GPS but not the camera, for privacy reasons.</p>
<h3>Runtime Permissions</h3>
<p>Android 6 (API level 23) uses a runtime permissions model, in which permissions can be turned on and off at run time, rather than install time.  With Android 6 permissions, you can grant an app certain permissions but not others, at run time. You can also turn permissions on and off at any time via the device's Settings.</p>
<p>To enforce the use of Android 6 permissions, the <code>targetSdkVersion</code> of your app must be at least 23; we looked at <code>targetSdkVersion</code> last week.</p>
<h3>Using the Android 6 permissions model</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must still declare the permissions you need in the manifest file</li>
<li>In addition, you now need to include logic in your application to perform checks on whether the appropriate permission has been granted. For example, before attempting to obtain the device's location using the GPS chip, your code needs to check whether the GPS permission has been granted by the user or not, and if it hasn't, the app needs to request the permission by asking the user whether they want to grant it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dangerous permissions</h4>
<p>Certain permissions in Android are more sensitive than others, these are
called <em>dangerous permissions</em>.  Dangerous permissions include location, using the GPS (for privacy reasons), camera (even more so) and file I/O
(because of the risk of a rogue app reading private data on your device).
It is <em>these dangerous permissions</em> which require runtime permission checking, and these permissions which can be turned on or off in the Settings.</p>
<p>Less sensitive permissions, such as internet, can be done purely via the manifest, as before; these do <em>not</em> need runtime permission checking.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview">this documentation on the Android site</a></p>
<h4>What happens from the user point of view?</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a user runs an app which uses dangerous permissions, a dialog is presented to the user, asking them whether they wish to grant or deny that permission (or strictly speaking, that permission group - certain permissions, such as reading files and writing files, are grouped together)</li>
<li>If a user presses 'grant', code associated with granting the permission (see below) will run</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as granting the permission at runtime, a user can grant permission by going into the phone's Settings, selecting "Apps" and then the appropriate app, and then turning the appropriate setting on. A user can also revoke the permission through the Settings.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation details</h3>
<h4>Checking whether a permission has been granted</h4>
<p>You use the <code>checkSelfPermission()</code> call for this, though it is recommended to use  <code>ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission()</code> from the Jetpack AppCompat library, to allow your code to run on older devices.
<p>Here is an example of checking for the <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> (listen to GPS) permission. This is in a custom function called <code>checkPermissions()</code>, which would be called from  <code>onCreate()</code>.
<pre>
fun checkPermissions() {
    val requiredPermission = Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION

    if(checkSelfPermission(requiredPermission) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) { 
        startGPS() // a function to start the GPS - see below
    } else {
        // Request the permission (see below for code)...
    }
}
</pre>
Note how checkSelfPermission() takes the permission we are interested in (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) as an argument.</p>
<p>This method will return one of these constants:
    <ul>
    <li><code>PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED</code> if the permission has already been granted by the user;</li>
    <li><code>PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED</code> if not.</li>
    </ul>
If you are targeting API level 23 and above, Android Studio's <em>lint</em> tool will produce an error if you leave this check out (and if you disable the <em>lint</em> tool, the app will crash at runtime with a SecurityException)</p>
<h4>Requesting permissions in your code</h4>
<p>If <code>checkSelfPermission()</code> returns <code>PackageManager.PERMISSION_DENIED</code>, then you should request that permission from the user in your code. This is done using a <em>launcher</em>. A launcher is an Android API class which is used to launch a task which requires user interaction (such as a permissions dialog), and runs a <em>callback</em> function (typically a lambda function) once the user has performed the required interaction. The launcher is created with <code>registerForActivityResult()</code> with parameters of <code>ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission()</code>, plus the lambda.
<pre>val permissionLauncher = registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission()) { isGranted -&gt;
    if(isGranted) {
        startGPS() // A function to start the GPS - see below
    } else {
        // Permission not granted
        Toast.makeText(this, "GPS permission not granted", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
    }
}
permissionLauncher.launch(requiredPermission)</pre>
Note how in this example, we create a launcher called <code>permissionLauncher</code> and specify a lambda function which takes one parameter, <code>isGranted</code>. This lambda will run as soon as the user either grants or denies the permission. The <code>isGranted</code> parameter will be either true or false, as a result. So the lambda will include logic to start the GPS (if the permission was granted) or inform the user that the permission was not granted (if not). Note how we use a <code>Toast</code> here - a small popup message which appears on the screen above the UI. <code>Toast</code> takes this form:
<pre>Toast.makeText (this, message, length).show()</pre>
<code>this</code> refers to the activity. <code>length</code> can either be 
Toast.LENGTH_SHORT or Toast.LENGTH_LONG.</p>
<p>We actually launch the launcher with :
<pre>permissionLauncher.launch(requiredPermission)</pre>
</p>
<p>We can request <em>multiple</em> permissions with <code>ActivityResultContracts.RequestMultiplePermissions()</code> and then pass an array of the required permissions to the launcher, e.g:
<pre>permissionLauncher.launch(arrayOf(Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, Manifest.permission.CAMERA))</pre>
</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Having covered runtime permission handling, we are now going to look at a key piece of functionality which <em>uses</em> it; obtaining your current <em>location</em>. Many of the most interesting mobile apps are <em>location-based apps</em>, in other words, the app is sensitive to the user's location on earth. We might, for instance, have an app which displays a map of your current location. Or an app which looks up the nearest pubs, bus stops or railway stations. Such apps send the user's <em>location</em> to a web server, which then delivers data near that location. Most smartphones contain a <em>GPS chip</em> which obtains the device's location by communicating with Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites: the same mechanism used in car satnav systems. So, since location is
so important in mobile app development, we are going to look at it now.</p>
<h3>Ethical issues with geolocation</h3>
<p>There are important ethical issues when it comes to location. Potentially,
a malicious app could gather your location and send it to a server with a user's personal details, which could allow the user to be tracked without their consent. For this reason, location tracking is treated as a dangerous permission and must be granted by the user at runtime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is recommended to create an explicit privacy policy on
your app's website (which can be linked to from Google Play) which spells
out to users why the app needs location information and what will be done
with it.</p>
<h4>Adding location permission to the manifest file</h4>
<p>There are two permissions for location: <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> for accurate (GPS) position, and <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code> (for less-accurate (wifi and cell-tower) position. As for any permission (dangerous and non-dangerous), you need to add the appropriate permission to the manifest:
<pre>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" /&gt;</pre>
</p>
<h3>Basic use of Geolocation</h3>
<p>This <em>incomplete</em> example shows how to obtain your location. Note
that a fully-working example would also need to check whether the <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> permission has been granted at runtime, and request it if not, using the technique described above.
<pre>package com.example.nickw.location

class MainActivity : ComponentActivity(), LocationListener {

    fun startGPS() {
        val mgr = getSystemService(LOCATION_SERVICE) as LocationManager
        mgr.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 0, 0f, this )
    }

    override fun onLocationChanged(location: Location) {
          Toast.makeText(this, "Latitude: ${location.latitude}, Longitude: ${location.longitude}", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show() 
    }

    override fun onProviderEnabled(provider: String) {
          Toast.makeText(this, "GPS enabled", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show() 

    }

    override fun onProviderDisabled(provider: String) {
          Toast.makeText(this, "GPS disabled", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show() 
    }

    // Deprecated at API level 29, but must still be included, otherwise your
    // app will crash on lower-API devices as their API will try and call it
    override fun onStatusChanged(provider: String, status: Int, extras: Bundle) {
    
    }
}</pre>
This code sample shows how to use the Location API. It will listen to the device's GPS and update the main content view with the current latitude and longitude (position on earth). So how does it work? The key thing is that there are three main components involved in obtaining your location: 
<ul>
<li>the <em>location provider</em> (representing the actual provider of your location, such as the GPS, WiFi network or cell tower network). A string is used to refer to the provider.</li>
<li>the <em>location manager</em> (class LocationManager) which controls access to the provider, allowing you to set such things as frequency of updates;</li>
<li>the <em>location listener</em> (the object which handles location updates, so that every time the GPS location changes, for example, code in the location listener will run to react to the change in location).
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To go through the code above in more detail:
<ul>
<li>First we obtain a LocationManager. We do not instantiate a LocationManager
object; instead we ask the system to obtain the default location manager for
us with:
<pre>val mgr: LocationManager = getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE)</pre>
</li>
<li>We then ask the location manager to update the app with new location informatiom, using:
<pre>mgr.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 0, 0f, this)</pre>
Note the parameters:
    <ul>
    <li>The first parameter specifies we are using a GPS provider (we could, alternatively, request a network provider - e.g. WiFi/cell tower - instead with
    <em>LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER</em>), though these are less accurate.</li>
    <li>The second parameter specifies the frequency of updates in milliseconds (0 means update as frequently as possible);</li>
    <li>The third parameter specifies the minimum distance we must travel, in metres, before an update is obtained (again 0 means update as frequently as possible);</li>
    <li>The fourth parameter specifies the <em>LocationListener</em> object which will process the location updates received - here it is <em>this</em>, i.e the current Activity will act as the LocationListener.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>A LocationListener is any object which <em>implements the LocationListener interface</em> e.g.
<pre>public class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), <em>LocationListener</em></pre>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In a <em>LocationListener</em>, you must provide four methods to handle different location events:
    <ul>
    <li><em>onLocationChanged()</em>, which takes a Location object as a parameter. This runs when a new location is received from the provider.</li>
    <li><em>onProviderDisabled()</em> and <em>onProviderEnabled()</em>, which run when you physically disable, or re-enable, that provider (e.g the GPS) from your device.  Often you can leave these blank but if you want specific behaviour to occur when the user switches the GPS on and off, you would write it here.</li>
    <li><em>onStatusChanged()</em> which runs when then status of the location provider changes, e.g. we lose the GPS signal. Again, this can be left blank for simple applications. In fact, this method is deprecated in API level 29 (the <a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationListener#onStatusChanged(java.lang.String,%20int,%20android.os.Bundle)'>documentation</a> states that "providers can be considered as always in the Location.Provider#AVAILABLE state", i.e. you can assume that the provider is always available, so it is rather unclear as to what happens if you lose GPS signal!). However, despite it being deprecated, you should still implement it, otherwise your app will crash on lower-API devices. This is because a device running an older version of Android might try to call this method at runtime, and if it is not present, you will get a runtime crash due to the method not being present in the compiled bytecode.</li>
    <li>For more on these methods, see
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationListener.html">the API documentation</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The<em>onLocationChanged()</em> method takes a single parameter - a <em>Location</em> object representing our current location. It has two properties, <em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em>, for getting the actual latitude and longitude. So, in this app, we simply display the current latitude and longitude with a <code>Toast</code>.</p>
<h4>Testing with a virtual device</h4>
<p>If you do not have a real device, or are located indoors (as you will probably be during the class; indoor GPS signals are not reliable) it is possible to test it in a development environment (with a GPS provider) by sending "virtual" locations to the emulator.</p> 
<p>This is quite straightforward. Click on the three dots (...) at the top of the controls of the virtual device:
<br />
<img src='../images/extendedcontrols1.png' alt='Accessing emulator extended controls' />
<br />
 This will take you to a dialog showing a map, by default located in Silicon Valley, California. You can change location by moving the map or searching for locations
and then clicking "Set Location.  This will send a virtual GPS signal to the device, containing the latitude and longitude entered.
<br />
<img src='../images/extendedcontrols2.png' alt='Emulator extended controls' />
</p>
<h2>Updating the UI using the GPS position</h2>
<p>How might you set the position of an osmdroid map to the GPS position, or even simply display the latitude and longitude on the UI? This is a little tricky as the map position is stored in <em>state</em> in a Compose application, as we saw two weeks ago, and state cannot be accessed outside composables (the GPS code will be outside our composables). How then can we communicate the GPS coordinates to the state variable of a composable?</p>
<p>The answer is to use a <strong>view model</strong> with <strong>live data</strong>.
</p>

<h2>The ViewModel</h2>

<p> A common aim in object-oriented programming is to make all classes as concise, and focused on one thing, as possible. This makes the classes smaller and easier to understand, and thus maintain. A small, tightly-focused class (focused on one particular thing) has high <em>cohesion</em>. Achieving high cohesion is well-known good software engineering practice, as you should know from OODD.</p>
<p>However, in Android development, if we are not careful our activities can quickly become very large and "bloated", and end up containing a lot of variables hoding the application's data and methods to manipulate that data. Thus they have low cohesion, as they are trying to do too many things. It would be better to try and <em>separate out the activity from its data</em> so that the activity only manages core operations (such as  <code>onCreate()</code> and setting up the UI) and have another class which stores the data.</p>
<p>Luckily we can do this quite easily with Android thanks to the use of a <code>ViewModel</code> (see <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel">the Android documentation</a>). What is a <code>ViewModel</code>? It's an object which holds <em>the data which needs to be displayed by the application</em>, and is responsible for "preparing data for the UI" (<a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel#implement">Android docs</a>), as part of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which we will return to in the database topic.</p>
<p>As well as enabling higher cohesion, using a <code>ViewModel</code> in Android has the advantage that it is <em>persistent throughout the lifetime of the application</em>, even if other components such as activities are destroyed. An important feature of Android that might not be obvious is that <strong>an activity is destroyed and re-created when it's rotated</strong>. This can cause difficulties if you want to preserve data; by default, all data stored in an activity will be destroyed when it's rotated, as it belongs to a particular instance of the activity. If you use a <code>ViewModel</code> instead, the data will be preserved and will be accessible by the activity when it is re-created.</p>
<p>Furthermore, use of a <code>ViewModel</code> allows data to be updated from non-UI parts of your application (e.g. the Location API as seen above) and then <em>observed</em> from your UI, such as Jetpack Compose. In this way, Compose UIs can be updated when data external to them, such as GPS location or a database, updates.</p>
<p><img src="../images/viewmodel2.png" alt="ViewModel" /></p>

<h3>Creating a ViewModel</h3>

<p>Creating a <code>ViewModel</code> is quite easy. We need to ensure the <code>lifecycle-runtime-ktx</code> Jetpack library into our <code>build.gradle</code> dependencies, e.g: <pre>implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx:2.5.1'</pre>
and create a class inheriting from <code>androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel</code>.
<pre>
package com.example.viewmodel1

import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel

class TestViewModel : ViewModel() {
    var firstName = ""
    var lastName = ""
}
</pre>
This is creating a simple <code>ViewModel</code> to store someone's first and last name.</p>

<h3>Using the ViewModel from an Activity</h3>

<p>We then need to initialise the <code>ViewModel</code> from an <code>Activity</code>. The example below shows how to do this:

<pre>
class MainActivity :AppCompatActivity() {

    val viewModel : TestViewModel by viewModels()

    // ... class continues ...
</pre>

Note how we declare a variable <code>viewModel</code> within our activity, of class <code>TestViewModel</code> (our <code>ViewModel</code> class shown above). Note also how we initialise it with a <em>delegate</em> (see last week).</p>
<h4>Updating the ViewModel and the UI</h4>
<p>Later on, at any point, we can update the <code>ViewModel</code>'s data, e.g.
<pre>
viewModel.apply {
    firstName = "Fred"
    lastName = "Jones"
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Clearly this is a very simple example, but for more complex apps, which need to store and display large amounts of data, a <code>ViewModel</code> makes sense. Furthermore, even in this simple example, a <code>ViewModel</code> can be advantageous, as the data remains in memory even when the device is rotated. If we simply stored the first name and last name in the activity, it would be lost when the device is rotated, as the activity (and all its data) is destroyed and re-created. The <code>ViewModel</code> by contrast is stored independently to the activity in memory.</p>

<h2>Using LiveData with ViewModel</h2>

<p>Commonly, <code>ViewModel</code> is used together with <strong><code>LiveData</code></strong>. A <code>ViewModel</code> can hold <code>LiveData</code> which is observed by an <code>Observer</code>. When the data changes, the <code>Observer</code> callback function - a lambda, typically - receives the altered data and uses it to update the UI. In a Compose application, a state variable would be updated with the altered live data from the view model.</p>
<p>We will use location data as our example of <code>LiveData</code>.
The latitude and longitude (from the Location API) will be stored in a <code>ViewModel</code> and made available as <code>LiveData</code> which the UI can then observe (so for example, a map can update with the latitude and longitude contained within the <code>LiveData</code>.)</p>
<p>First the <code>ViewModel</code>, which contains a <code>LatLon</code> object and a <code>LiveData</code> object wrapping that <code>LatLon</code>:

<pre>
data class LatLon(val lat: Double, val lon: Double) // our LatLon class

class LatLonViewModel: ViewModel() {
    var latLon = LatLon(51.05, -0.72)
        set(newValue) {
            field = newValue
            latLonLiveData.value = newValue
        }

    var latLonLiveData = MutableLiveData&lt;LatLon&gt;()
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how we use a <em>custom setter</em> with the <code>latLon</code> object within the view model (we introduced these in topic 5). In the custom setter we update the live data as well as the <code>latLon</code> object itself. This ensures that the <em>live data</em> tracks the <code>latLon</code> object itself and keeps in sync with it.
<pre>latLonLiveData.value = newValue</pre>
</p>
<p>
We can then update the <code>latLon</code> in the view model from our <code>onLocationChanged()</code>, when the GPS location changes:
<pre>latLonViewModel.latLon = LatLon(location.latitude, location.longitude)</pre>
</p>
<h3>Observing the LiveData</h3>
<p>We observe the <code>LiveData</code> from our UI by calling its <code>observe()</code> method. <code>observe()</code> expects either an <code>Observer</code> object, or a lambda which will run whenever the live data changes:
<pre>latLonViewModel.latLonLiveData.observe(this) {
    // inside the lambda, "it" will be the LatLon being observed; use it to update the UI
}</pre>
</p>
<h2>Map Markers</h2>
<p>This topic is relatively easy compared to some of the recent topics but is important to know if you are developing any sort of geographically-aware app: the ability to add <em>markers</em> to a mapping application. Many geographically-aware apps show points of interest as <em>markers</em> on the map. </p>

<h3>How to code markers in osmdroid</h3>
<h4>Adding markers to a map</h4>
<p>The incomplete example below (only relevant code is shown) demonstrates how to add markers to a map:
<pre>
import org.osmdroid.views.overlay.Marker // needed for marker

AndroidView (

    factory =  { ctx -&gt;
           Configuration.getInstance()
            .load(ctx, PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(ctx))

        val map1 = MapView(ctx).apply { 
            setMultiTouchControls(true)
            setTileSource(TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK)
            controller.setZoom(14.0)
        }
        val marker = Marker(map1)
        marker.apply {
            position = GeoPoint(51.05, -0.72)
            title = "Fernhurst, village in West Sussex"
        }
        map1.overlays.add(marker)
        map1 // last statement is return value of lambda
    }
    // ...
}
</pre>
Note what we are doing here: 
    <ul>
    <li>We are creating a <code>Marker</code> and passing our map object into it:
<pre>val marker = Marker(map1)</pre>
</li>
<li>
We then use <code>apply()</code> to set various properties of the <code>Marker</code>:
<pre>marker.apply {
    position = GeoPoint(51.05, -0.72)
    title = "Fernhurst, village in West Sussex"
}</pre>
</li>
<li>The <code>title</code> will appear in a popup when the user presses the marker.</li>
<li>Finally, we add it to the map's <em>overlays</em>. Overlays are items that can be added to the map, including markers, polylines and polygons.
<pre>map1.overlays.add(marker)
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Custom markers</h3>
<p>So far we have used the built-in osmdroid marker. However we can use
<em>custom markers</em> for our app. Here is how we do this :
<pre>marker.apply {
    icon = getDrawable(R.drawable.marker)
}</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how the we use the method <code>getDrawable()</code>.
This is an object of type <code>Drawable</code> representing the marker icon. We obtain a <code>Drawable</code> by supplying the resource ID <code>R.drawable.marker</code> as a parameter to <code>getDrawable()</code>. The resource ID
    <code>R.drawable.marker</code> points to an image <code>marker.png</code> 
    in the <code>drawable</code>
    folder (the folder storing drawables, i.e. images and icons)
    within the <code>res</code> folder of the project. </p>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use the code examples above to produce a complete Jetpack Compose app which displays the current GPS latitude and longitude on-screen within <code>Text</code> composables. When the GPS position updates, the <code>Text</code> composables should update. You will need to use runtime permission checking, the Location API, and a <code>ViewModel</code> with <code>LiveData</code>.</li>
<li>Extend the first question to include an osmdroid map. The centre of the map should be set to the GPS position.</li>
<li>Find points of interest in your home town (such as pubs, churches, restaurants, sports grounds, etc) in your home town, and add markers to each. Test it out by setting the fake GPS position in the emulator to your home town.</li>
<li>Use different markers for different point of interest types. There are some sample markers <a href="https://www.free-map.org.uk/fm/icons">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Store the points of interest in your <code>ViewModel</code> as a list of items and make them available as <code>LiveData</code>. Observe the <code>LiveData</code> from your UI and add markers for each point of interest in the <code>LiveData</code>.
    <ul>
    <li><em>Hint:</em> you can clear all overlays on a map with:
    <pre>map.overlays.clear()</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
