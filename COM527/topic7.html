<h1>Mobile Application Development - Part 7</h1>
<h1>Coroutines</h1>
</div>

<p>This week will look at the general Kotlin concept of <em>coroutines</em>.
This will be done in a slightly different way to normal, and will consist of an interactive session on <a href='https://lilt.hikar.org'>lilt</a>. If you are doing WAD, you will be familiar with <code>lilt</code>. If you are not, it is an interactive learning tool which allows you to answer "quizzes" to unlock new content. Please obtain a user code on <code>lilt</code> before using it, and login with the user code.</p>
