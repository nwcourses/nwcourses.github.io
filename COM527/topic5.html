<h1>Mobile Application Development - Part 5</h1>
<h1>Menus and Multiple Activities</h1>
</div>

<p>In this section we will:
    <ul>
    <li>Look at menus</li>
    <li>Look at how to create a multiple-activity application</li>
    <li>Look at how to pass data between activities</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Menus and Multiple Activities</h2>
<p>So far, our apps have contained just one <em>Activity</em>, or screen to interact with the user. However, a typical app will contain <em>several</em> activities, each of which gathers different data from the user. The next section will cover how to create a second Activity, and how to pass data between activities. The second Activity is going to be a screen containing two buttons, to allow the user to choose the style of map to show on our map app (regular map, or opentopomap view). </p>
<h3>The goal</h3>
<p>We will be allowing the user to choose between the regular map and OpenTopoMap - a different style oriented towards walkers and cyclists. To see the latter effectively, ensure your default map location is:
    <ul>
    <li>Latitude 51.05</li>
    <li>Longitude -0.72</li>
    <li>Zoom level 14</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Menus</h3>
<p>Before we create the second Activity, we are going to add a <em>menu</em> to our map app from the previous section.  Most Android apps contain a menu of some sort.  There are various methods for implementing a menu in Android. Menus are activated via the <em>action bar</em> - the bar at the top of the app, often in a custom colour, which contains the app's actions. </p>
<p>There are two common styles of menu:
    <ul>
    <li>First, the classic "three dots" style of menu on the right-hand side of the action bar. The menu appears when you press on the three dots.</li>
    <li>The "hamburger menu"
    (three horizontal lines) on the left of the action bar which brings up a slide-out menu (or <em>navigation drawer</em>) on the left of the screen.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The "three dots" style menu is the classic style, still used by some apps today.  We will be examining this style of menu in this unit; the navigation drawer is used by many contemporary apps but is more complex to implement so we will leave it until the end of the module.</p>
<p>
To create your menu, right click on the <em>res</em> directory of your app and then create a new Menu resource. Give it a name of <code>menu.xml</code>.
<br />
<img src='../images/createmenu.png' alt='Android Studio - create menu resource' />
<br />
Add this code to the <code>menu.xml</code> file:
<pre>
&lt;menu
  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt;
&lt;item android:id="@+id/choosemap" android:title="@string/choosemap"/&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;
</pre>
Note that there is a &lt;menu&gt; tag to define the menu as a whole, while each
item is defined as an &lt;item&gt; tag.
The item has an ID of <em>choosemap</em> and a title equal to the string with
the name of <em>choosemap</em> (which should be
defined in the strings.xml file).</p>
<h4>Making the menu appear</h4>
<p>The code above defines a menu in XML, however it does not actually make the menu appear.
In our Java code we have to explicitly <em>inflate the menu</em>. To do this 
you add an <em>onCreateOptionsMenu()</em> method to your main activity. 
<pre>
override fun onCreateOptionsMenu(menu: Menu) : Boolean {
    // In Java we would need to use getMenuInflater()
    // In Kotlin, we can just use 'menuInflater' instead (see the notes on
    // Kotlin properties in week 2)
    menuInflater.inflate(R.menu.menu, menu)
    return true
}
</pre>
and you have to add the following new import lines:
<pre>
import android.view.Menu
import android.view.MenuInflater
import android.view.MenuItem
</pre>
The code above will run automatically when the activity is created; it basically loads in the menu from the XML (<em>R.menu.menu</em> is referencing
the <em>menu.xml</em> file)
and "inflates" it so that it can be seen in the GUI. Note
that the example assumes that your menu is saved in the file 
<em>menu.xml</em>. If your menu is saved in another file, you need
to change the reference to <em>R.menu.menu</em> appropriately.</p>
<p>
If you add this code to your map app and run it, you should find that a menu with one item
appears when you press the Menu button.</p>
<h3>Reacting to a menu item selection</h3>
<p>Next thing we want to do is to launch a second Activity when the user selects the menu
item. First thing to do is to write code to respond to the user selecting a menu item. 
To do this, you override <em>onOptionsItemSelected()</em> in Activity. Here is 
an example:
<pre>
override fun onOptionsItemSelected(item: MenuItem) : Boolean {
    when(item.itemId) {
        R.id.choosemap -&gt; {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
</pre>
The <em>onOptionsItemSelected()</em> method takes a MenuItem as a parameter, which is the menu item which was selected. We can find out which MenuItem was selected by using the <em>itemId</em> property of the MenuItem (again, we are using Kotlin property syntax here; in Java we would need to use <em>getItemId()</em>). This will return the item's ID as defined in the menu.xml file. So in this example, if the menu item with the ID of <em>choosemap</em> was selected, we do something.</p>
<h3>Launching a second Activity</h3>
<p>To launch a second Activity we create an <em>Intent</em>. An Intent
basically represents an
instruction to do something, such as launch a second Activity or 
even use the services of an entirely different app. Data can be added 
to the Intent; that is how we send data between activities.
</p>
<p>
Add the following code to the if statement above:
<pre>
val intent = Intent(this,MapChooseActivity::class.java)
startActivity(intent)
</pre>
and add the following additional import:
<pre>
import android.content.Intent
</pre>
This code creates a new Intent. The two parameters are a reference to the current Activity (this) and the MapChooseActivity <em>class</em>. This is a variable representing the class, not an instance of it. (The perhaps-strange-looking <em>.java</em> at the end indicates that this is a Java class, not a Kotlin class; this is because <code>MapChooseActivity</code> will inherit from <code>AppCompatActivity</code>, a Java class; we can only leave out the <code>.java</code> if working with a pure-Kotlin class not inheriting from any Java classes.) </p>
<p>We haven't created this Activity yet but this is intended to be our second Activity. We then start up our activity with <em>startActivity()</em>.</p>
<h3>Creating the second Activity</h3>
<p>We now need to create our second Activity. This will offer the user a choice to which map style to use - either the regular style, or a public transport view showing bus routes, train routes, etc. This will be done using a pair of buttons. The appropriate map style will be set depending on which button the user pressed.  (This is not the most friendly way, it would be better
to use radio buttons or a list, but it will do for now).
Do this as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>In Studio, select the <em>java</em> folder:
    <br />
    <img src="../images/newjavaclass.png" alt="New Class" />
    <br />
    and then select <em>File-New-Kotlin Class or File</em>. Select Kotlin class and enter the name <em>MapChooseActivity</em>.</li>
    <li>Add the following code to the new class:
    <pre>
    package ..... // LEAVE YOUR PACKAGE UNCHANGED, do not literally write this!

    import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
    import android.os.Bundle
    import android.content.Intent
    import android.widget.Button
    import android.view.View

    class MapChooseActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_map_choose)
        }
    }
    </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Note the <em>setContentView(R.layout.activity_map_choose)</em>.  This sets the main content view
    of the activity to a layout defined in an (as yet uncreated) XML file called
    <em>activity_map_choose.xml</em>. You are going to add this next.</li>
    <li>Now add this new layout file.  Highlight the <em>layout</em> folder
    inside <em>res</em> (in a similar way to how you highlighted the
    <em>menu</em> folder when creating a menu) and
    select <em>File-New-Layout resource file</em>
    and enter the filename <em>activity_map_choose.xml</em>. Add the following
    code to the activity_map_choose.xml file:
    <pre>
    &lt;LinearLayout
      xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      android:orientation="vertical"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="match_parent"&gt;
    &lt;Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/regularview" 
    android:id="@+id/btnRegular" /&gt;
    &lt;Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/opentopomapview" 
    android:id="@+id/btnOpenTopoMap" /&gt;
    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
    </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Add appropriate entries to your strings.xml file, i.e. "regularview"
    and "opentopomapview" with appropriate text.</li>
    <li>Lastly (and this is a step which is often forgotten) you have to add the second
    activity to the manifest file. This step actually associates the activity with this
    app. Open your manifest file again, and, immediately after the 
    <em>&lt;/activity&gt;</em> tag of the main activity, add the code:
    <pre> 
&lt;activity android:name=".MapChooseActivity" android:label="@string/selectmap"&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;</pre>
    (The label should be a reference into your strings.xml file. You'll need to add
    a "selectmap" entry in your strings.xml file).
    </li>
    </ul>
Run your app now. You should find that if you select the menu option, the second activity with the three buttons appears.
Note that you can then press the phone's Back button
to return to your original activity.</p>
<h3>Sending data back to the original activity</h3>
<p>OK, we have a second activity created but we don't yet send the user's chosen option back to the original activity. How is this done? Basically we have to create another Intent in the second activity and send it back to the first.</p>
<p>The first, and easiest, step is to <em>send the data back to the main activity from the second activity</em>. The slightly harder second step is to <em>set up the original activity to receive data from the second</em>. So let's being with sending the user's choice back from the second activity to the first. You'll need to add some code to the <em>the second activity</em> to handle the button press. Here is some example code, which should go inside the second activity's <code>onCreate()</code>:
<pre>
val regular = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.btnRegular)
regular.setOnClickListener {
    sendBackMapChoice(false)
}
val opentopomap = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.btnOpenTopoMap)
opentopomap.setOnClickListener {
    sendBackMapChoice(true)
}
</pre>
Note how we add lambdas to each button, to handle click events on each. Each
lambda then calls the method <code>sendBackMapChoice()</code> (to be discussed below) and passes an appropriate Boolean to it. This Boolean represents whether or not the opentopomap was chosen.</p>
<p>We now need to send this value back to the main activity. 
As briefly mentioned above, we can do this by sending an Intent back to the
main activity, containing this boolean value. As well as launching a given Activity, we can use Intents to <em>pass information between activities</em>.</p> 
<p>We will now write the <code>sendBackMapChoice()</code> method inside the
<code>MapChooseActivity</code> to do this, with the following code:
<pre>
fun sendBackMapChoice(opentopo: Boolean) {
    val intent = Intent()
    val bundle = bundleOf("com.example.opentopomap" to opentopo)
    intent.putExtras(bundle)
    setResult(RESULT_OK, intent)
    finish()
}
</pre>
This code, specifically <code>bundleOf()</code>, creates something called a <em>Bundle</em>. A Bundle is basically a collection of data which can be passed around between Activities - think of it as a collection of key-value pairs. Here, the bundle contains one item - a boolean storing whether the OpenTopoMap is being used. </p>
<p>Note also how the entry in the bundle is labelled with the identifier
<em>com.example.opentopomap</em>. Many entries can be placed in one bundle, so each
needs to be identified uniquely. It is convention to start each entry with your
domain name reversed (such as <em>com.example</em> here), hence <em>com.example.opentopomap</em>, the <em>opentopomap</em> bundle entry belonging to the <em>example.com</em> domain.</p>
<p>
Having created the Bundle, we then add it to the intent and then call <em>setResult</em> to send a <em>result</em> back to the parent activity. You can think of a <em>result</em> as a little like a return code for a function. Here, we send back the result <em>RESULT_OK</em> to indicate to the calling activity (the app's main activity) that the secondary activity completed successfully. (You can also send back <em>RESULT_CANCELED</em> to indicate that the user cancelled the action in the second activity). Finally we call <em>finish()</em> to forcibly finish the activity.</p>
<h3>Reading the data from the first activity</h3>
<p>Slightly more complex is the process of <em>reading the data sent from the second activity in the first activity</em>. This involves creating an object known as a <em>launcher</em>. A launcher allows you to launch a second activity and receive data from it. When creating a launcher, we specify a lambda function which will run when we receive the data from the second activity. In this lambda function, the data sent back from the second activity is processed.</p>
<p>To use a launcher we have to add an extra dependency in <code>build.gradle</code>:
<pre>implementation 'androidx.fragment:fragment-ktx:1.3.5'</pre>
If on your own computer, you should be able to use the most up-to-date version (1.4.1) instead, but this version will not work on the university computers as it requires API level 31 which is not installed.</p>
<!--
<p>We declare the launcher this way, as an attribute of our main activity class:
<pre>private lateinit var mapChooseLauncher: ActivityResultLauncher<Intent></pre>
Before we continue, we need to explain <code>lateinit</code>. In some cases, such as this, we may need to use a variable which <strong>we know will never be null</strong> (so we don't make it nullable) but <strong>we cannot initialise it when the class is first created</strong>. This is common in Android development, where frequently, we can only create objects in <code>onCreate()</code>, once the activity is fully initialised. So in these cases, we declare the variables <code>lateinit</code> to indicate that they will be initialised later, after the class is first created.</p>
-->
<p>So we initialise the launcher in our activity, this can be done directly inside the class, outside any of its methods:
<pre>
val mapChooseLauncher =
    registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()) {
        // The lambda function starts here
        // Check that we get an OK (success) result from the second activity
        if (it.resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            it.data?.apply {
                val opentopomap = this.getBooleanExtra("com.example.opentopomap", false) // false is a default value

                // See "lateinit" in week 6 for a way of doing this more efficiently
                val map1 = findViewById&lt;MapView&gt;(R.id.map1)
                map1.setTileSource( if (opentopomap) TileSourceFactory.OpenTopo else TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK )
            }
        }
        // The lambda function ends here
    }
</pre>
Unfortunately, the API for creating the launcher is rather wordy (a common feature - some might say fault - of the Android API) but the concept is actually quite simple. <code>registerForActivityResult()</code> is a function which creates and returns a launcher. It takes two arguments, the first (<code>ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()</code>) describes the behaviour of the launcher (which only needs to change in specialised cases), and the second (the lambda) is the function which processes the result sent back from our second activity. So in summary, we are <strong>creating a launcher object</strong> and then <strong>specifying a lambda function to run when we get a result sent back from the second activity</strong>. Also note how <strong>when a lambda is supplied as the last argument to a function, it can be moved out of the parentheses</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's now look in more detail at the lambda which runs when we receive the result from the second activity. Firstly, it will receive one parameter: an <code>ActivityResult</code> object representing the result from the second activity. As there is only one parameter, we can refer to it using <code>it</code>, as we saw in week 2.</p
<p>If the <code>ActivityResult</code>'s <code>resultCode</code> was <code>RESULT_OK</code>, this means that the user successfully chose a map type from the second activity. (Alternatively, the <code>resultCode</code> will be <code>RESULT_CANCELED</code> if the user pressed the Back button from the second activity without making a choice). So, if the user did make a map choice, we then obtain the <code>Intent</code> returned from the second activity with <code>it.data</code> (the <code>data</code> attribute of the <code>ActivityResult</code>). We then extract the bundle data that we originally sent from the second Activity within the Bundle (see above) and set the map tile source to either <code>OpenTopo</code> (OpenTopoMap) or <code>MAPNIK</code> (the default map) depending on what was sent back from the second activity.</p>
<p><em>Note the use of <code>apply()</code></em> on the <code>Intent</code> returned. This is a nice technique to avoid having to use an <code>if</code> statement to check whether <code>it.data</code> (the <code>Intent</code>) is null. Instead, we use <code>apply()</code> with the safe-access operator <code>?.</code> and specify a lambda. Inside the lambda specified with <code>apply()</code>, the <code>this</code> keyword will refer to the object which <code>apply()</code> is called on, i.e. <code>it.data</code> here. The nice thing about this approach is that the lambda will never be called if <code>it.data</code> is null (due to the safe-access operator), resulting in arguably more elegant and concise code compared to using an <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>The final part of the equation is to change our code to launch the second activity so that it uses the launcher. To do this, change the line:
    <pre>startActivity(intent)</pre>
    to
    <pre>mapChooseLauncher.launch(intent)</pre>
    This launches the second activity using the launcher we have provided.</p>
    </pre>
</p>
<!--
<h3>Using an interface rather than a lambda to process the result</h3>
<p>In Week 2 we mentioned the use of <em>SAM conversions</em> to allow us to use a lambda in place of implementing an interface with one method. We have done this here. However, it's possible in some cases that you may wish to use an interface directly instead. The lambda is wrapping the <code>ActivityResultCallback</code> interface, which specifies one method, <code>onActivityResult()</code>. So we could instead make our activity implement this interface e.g.
<pre>
class MyActivity: AppCompatActivity, <em>ActivityResultCallback&lt;ActivityResult&gt;</em>
</pre>
and then provide an <code>onActivityResult()</code> method in our activity, to process the result from the second activity:
<pre>
override fun onActivityResult(result: ActivityResult) {
    // Check that we get an OK (success) result from the second activity
    if (result.resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        result.data?.apply {
            val opentopomap = this.getBooleanExtra("com.example.opentopomap", false) // false is a default value
            val map1 = findViewById&lt;MapView&gt;(R.id.map1)
            map1.setTileSource( if (opentopomap) TileSourceFactory.OpenTopo else TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK )
        }
    }
}
</pre>
We'd then need to pass in a reference to our <code>Activity</code> (as it is implementing <code>ActivityResultCallback</code>) as the second argument when creating the launcher:
<pre>mapChooseLauncher =
    registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult(), <em>this</em>)
</pre>
</p> 
-->
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a <em>new</em> mapping project in Android Studio. This should be
separate from your work from last week with GPS and permissions, and should just contain a simple OSMDroid map, as for Topic 3, Exercise 2. Ensure you add OSMDroid as a dependency in your build.gradle and create a layout containing a map - again, see Topic 3, Exercise 2.</li>
<li>Use the code snippets and guidance above to get the example  (allowing the user to change the map style from a separate activity) working.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>third activity</strong> to allow the user to enter a latitude and longitude and set the map to this location. 
To do this:
    <ul>
    <li>Add a further menu option to your app from above labelled
    "Set Location".</li>
    <li>Create a third activity to allow the user to enter a latitude and
    longitude. Give it an XML layout file with two EditTexts, one for latitude and one for longitude, and a button.  When the button is clicked, the latitude and longitude should be read from the EditTexts and sent back to the main activity in a Bundle in an Intent. <strong>Hint:</strong> you can store more than one item in a bundle using code such as: 
<pre>val bundle = bundleOf("key1" to value1, "key2" to value2)</pre></li>
    <li>Create a new launcher object to handle receiving the result from the third activity, and use this launcher to launch the third activity when the user selects the "Set Location" menu option. In the launcher's lambda, set the latitude and longitude of the map to the contents of the Bundle from the Intent.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
