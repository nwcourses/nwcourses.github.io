<h2>1. Hello World.</h2>

<p>
For this introductory, non-Android Kotlin session, we are going to be using Android Studio, as it allows us to write console programs as well as Android apps. Launch Android Studio and then create a new project. Ensure you select <em>No activity</em>, as shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/android_studio_console_create.png" alt="Creating an empty project" />
<br />
The project will be initialised but will have no source code files. You will need to add a Kotlin source code file to the project, do this as shown below:

<br />
<img src="../images/android_studio_add_file.png" alt="Adding a file to your project" />
<br />
Then, compile and run the Kotlin program by right-clicking on it. The output will appear at the bottom of the screen.

</p> 

<h2>2. Loops and ifs – basic</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a new program, ex2.kt. The program should ask the user to
input their name and then should print it 10 times.</li>
<li>Modify the program so that it also asks how many times they want to display
their name. HINT: readLine() might return null. See the section “A practical example, and introducing Elvis”</li>
</ul>




<h2>3. Looping through an array</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Create a new program which stores an array of your
avourite music artists.
the program should then prompt the user to ask the user to input an artist
name. Use a loop to keep prompting the user until they guess one of the correct artists.

</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. when</h2>

<p>Write a program which uses a "when" statement to print the grade (A, B, C, D, E,
or F) equivalent to a given percentage. Make the 'when' act as an expression,
i.e. you should get it to return a value and then print that value.
Grades are as follows:
<pre>
A - 70-100
B - 60-69
C - 50-59
D - 40-49
E - 30-39
F – 0-29
</pre>

The program should also display "Error - invalid percentage" if the percentage is
below 0 or greater than 100.

Hint: you can use the "in" keyword with a range (e.g. 1..10) as a condition inside
"when".
</p>


<h2>Classes and objects (do in your own time if necessary)</h2>

<p>
Create a Car class. It should have properties for make, model, engine capacity
(cc), top speed, and current speed (mph or km/h - up to you). The first four
should be passed in via the constructor.
Set the current speed to 0 when the car initialises.
Add accelerate() and decelerate() methods. These should increase and decrease
the speed by a value passed into the method as a parameter. decelerate()
should ideally check to make sure that the speed doesn't go below 0 and
accelerate() should ideally check to make sure that the speed doesn't go above
the top speed.
Add a toString() method to return a string representation of the car. You need to
use the override keyword with this, because it’s overriding the superclass
method, i.e.
<pre>
override fun toString(): String {...
}
</pre>
Write a main() function. In main(), try creating two car objects. Display the car
objects, accelerate them, display them again, decelerate them again, and
display them once more
</p>

<h2>6. Inheritance (advanced; do in your own time if necessary)</h2>

<p>
You need to look at the further notes to answer this question.
Create an inheritance hierarchy involving employees, programmers and
managers.
<ul>
<li>
The Employee class should have attributes for name, job title and salary.</li>
<li>
The Programmer class, inheriting from Employee, should in addition have an
attribute for favourite language (which should be a String) and current project (a
String).</li>
<li>
The Manager class, also inheriting from Employee, should in addition attributes
for companyCar (a Car - borrow the class from the previous exercise) and
number of shares in the company.</li>
</ul>
Give each class a printDetails() method which prints the full details of objects of
that class.
Write a main() function to test your inheritance hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Enhancement: change Programmer so that the favourite language string is
replaced by an array of strings for multiple favourite languages (e.g. Kotlin, Java,
PHP, Python and JavaScript).
