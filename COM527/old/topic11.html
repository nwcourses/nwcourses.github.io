<h1>Mobile Application Development - Part 11</h1>
<h1>Introduction to the Activity Lifecycle, Services and Broadcasts</h1>
</div>

<h2>The Android Activity Lifecycle</h2>

<p>To understand Android development more fully it is useful to have
understanding of the <em>Android activity lifecycle</em>.</p>
<p>Mobile apps are not quite like standard desktop applications. In particular,
<em>the application may be interrupted</em>, most commonly by the user
answering a phone call. Also, users commonly switch from one app to another.
Unless the user quits the app using the "back" button, when this happens
<em>the original app is still running in the background</em>.</p>
<p> 
To manage these possiblities, Android activities have a defined 
<em>lifecycle</em>. The idea is to code activities to respond to the different
points in the lifecycle. The lifecycle consists of a series of methods which run
one after the other, as follows. When coding your app, you override whichever
methods you want specific behaviour to occur at. With practically every
activity, this includes <code>onCreate()</code>, but your activity might need
to override the others too.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/lifecycle.png" alt="The Android activity lifecycle" />
</p>
<p>It is described in full
on the Android website, 
<a href='http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle'>
here</a>.</p>
<p>
The original article describes the lifecycle in full but to summarise,
the following methods run when certain events occur:
    <ul>
    <li><code><em>onCreate()</em></code>: runs when the application is first launched.
    Note also that certain actions, such as changing the device orientation,
    can force the activity to be destroyed and recreated, which will cause <code>onCreate()</code> to re-run.</li>
    <li><code><em>onStart()</em></code> and <code><em>onResume()</em></code>: both run when the activity becomes visible. This can either be when it first becomes visible, or becomes visible again after being hidden. For example, it will be called
    after you return to the current Activity after using a completely different application, or after closing a second activity within the same application, e.g. a
    preferences screen, causing the original activity to become visible again.
    See the discussion of <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onStop()</code>, below, for the difference between the two.</li>
    <li><code><em>onPause()</em></code>: when the activity pauses after being fully visible, and focused. This happens on shutdown of the activity, or when another activity comes in front of the current activity, <strong>including activities not occupying the whole of the screen.</strong></li>
    <li><code><em>onStop()</em></code>: is called immediately after <code>onPause()</code> but <em>only</em> on shutdown, or if the activity coming in front of the current one <strong>occupies the whole of the screen</strong>. </li>
    <li><code><em>onResume()</em></code> is the opposite of <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onStart()</code> is the opposite of <code>onStop()</code>. Thus, <code>onResume()</code> is called when the current activity becomes visible and focused again after removing an activity in front of it (or when launching the activity), <strong>including cases where the activity on top of the current activity, which has just been removed, does not occupy the whole of the screen</strong>. By contrast, <code>onStart()</code> is only called either on startup or when the activity on top of the current activity, now being removed, occupies the whole of the screen.</li> 
<li><code><em>onDestroy()</em></code>: runs when the user dismisses the application. This will happen
    when the user presses the Back button from the main activity. It can also be called under other
    circumstances, e.g. Android kills the activity due to low memory, or when the user rotates the
    device.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The lifecycle can have important consequences for development. For example, in a mapping app you might want to stop GPS communication when the activity becomes invisible and start it again when it becomes visible again (to save battery), in which case you would stop the GPS in <code>onPause()</code> and start it in <code>onResume()</code>. If you did this in <code>onDestroy()</code> and <code>onCreate()</code> instead, the GPS would still be running if the activity was running but invisible, which for a mapping app would be unnecessary.</p>
<p>The differences between <code>onStart()</code>/<code>onStop()</code> and <code>onResume()</code>/<code>onPause()</code> are quite subtle and need only be considered if you are writing activities which do not occupy the whole of the screen, which is not so common. Generally, <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onResume()</code> are more commonly used.</p>

<h2>Services</h2>
<div>

<h3>Leaving tasks running when the app is shut down</h3>
<p>Frequently in an app we need to perform a task when the activity has been <em>completely shut down</em>.  For example, in a music player, we probably want the music to continue to play when the user has closed the player's main activity - and we want the user to be able to pause or rewind the same music when they relaunch the activity.  
Another example might be a mapping application in which the user would like to record their walking route using GPS. We want the recording to continue even if the user closes the activity - and allow the user to stop the recording if they re-launch the activity.</p>
</div>
<h3>Introduction to Services</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
To deal with these scenarios we use <code>Service</code>s 
(see the Android developer documentation for full details - <a href='https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html'>here</a>).</li>
<li>A Service is a background application component which is part of an application but is independent of any of the application's Activities.</li>
<li>As they are part of the application, we have to declare all our services in the manifest, immediately after declaring our activities e.g.
<pre>&lt;service android:name=".MusicService"&gt;&lt;/service&gt;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Difference between a service and a coroutine</h3>
<ul>
<li>
It is important to note that a Service is not the same as a coroutine.</li>
<li>It is a separate component to an Activity, but by default it does not run in the background.</li>
<li>If you wish your service to perform tasks such as connecting to the Internet, you will need to implement a coroutine within the service and switch to a background context</li>
<li>To launch coroutines from a service, you need to use the <code>androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleService</code> class rather than an ordinary <code>Service</code>; this requires the dependency <code>androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-service:X.Y.Z</code> where <code>X.Y.Z</code> is the version; the current version is 2.7.0.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Intents</h3>
<p>To understand services, you need to understand <code>Intent</code>s, which are used to communicate between activities and services. What is an <code>Intent</code>? Essentially, it's a message which can be sent in between Android application components, such as between an activity and a service (in both directions) or to launch a second activity from the main activity. They can also be used to launch <em>entirely separate applications</em>; for example you can launch the standard camera app from your own app in order to take a picture. Intents contain two important components:
    <ul>
    <li>An <em>action</em>. This specifies what the intent <em>does</em>. The recipient of an intent can test the action, and in doing so, understand what the intent is telling it to do. (An activity or service can receive multiple intents).</li>
    <li><em>Data</em>. Data can be added to an intent as <em>extras</em>, and in doing so, data can be passed from one application component to another.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div>
<h3>Implementing a Service</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must create a class (separate to your Activity) which extends from <code>android.app.Service</code> and then launch it from the main activity.</li>
<li>To launch a Service, you can either <em>start</em> or <em>bind</em> it, 
or both.</li>
<li><em>Starting</em> a service is intended for long-running services, which will run even if the Activity you start them from is closed down. </li>
<li><em>Binding</em> a service is intended for shorter-running services,
which are bound to a particular instance of an Activity and will stop when the Activity shuts down (e.g. a music player which only plays while the Activity is running). Binding is useful if you want to be able to access the service directly from the activity; if you start the service and do not bind it, you are unable to do this.</li>
<li>Even though in many cases you do not need to bind a service, you must still provide the <code>onBind()</code> method in your service, but it can return <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>It is possible to <em>both start and bind</em> a service, if you want the service to keep running when the activity is destroyed <strong>and</strong> you want to easily access it from the activity.</li>
<li>Example of a template service:
<pre>
import android.app.Service
import android.content.Intent
import android.os.IBinder

class MyService: Service() {

    // start handler
    override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
        return START_STICKY // we will look at this return value below
    }

    // bind handler - not needed in many cases but defined as an abstract
    // method in Service, therefore must be overridden
    override fun onBind(intent: Intent?): IBinder? {
        return null // can just return null if binding is not needed
    }

}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Service lifecycle methods</h3>
<p>Rather like activities, services have lifecycle methods including:
    <ul>
    <li><code>onCreate()</code> - when the service is created;</li>
    <li><code>onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, startFlags: Int, id: Int): Int </code> - runs when a service is started (see below);</li>
    <li><code> onBind(intent: Intent?): IBinder?</code> - runs when a service is bound. As seen above, you have to implement this even if you do not use binding, but it can just return <code>null</code></li>
    <li><code>onDestroy()</code> - when a service is destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Starting a service</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starting a service is the easiest, you create an Intent to start a particular Service (similar to creating an Intent to launch a secondary activity) and then call startService():
<pre>
val startIntent = Intent(this, MusicService::class.java)
startService(startIntent)
</pre>
</li>
<li>This will have the effect both of creating a long-lasting service (which will continue until the service has done its work), though it may be killed if memory becomes low</li>
<li>Generally you should make your service a <em>background service</em> (the default). You can alternatively make it a <em>foreground service</em> if you want to minimise the chance of it being killed due to low memory, however this is not recommended as it might result in apps the user is actively using being killed instead. <a href='https://commonsware.com/blog/2014/07/27/role-services.html'>Mark Murphy</a>, a well-known authority in Android development, talks about this issue with services. If you really do need a foreground service, you must also provide a notification to the user.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Using onStartCommand() to start the service</h4>
<ul>
<li>As we have seen, <code>onStartCommand()</code> is called when a service is started with <code>startService()</code></li>
<li>The return value is important; if you want the service to be restarted if it is killed when memory becomes low, you should return a value of <code>START_STICKY</code> (see <a href='https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/02/service-api-changes-starting-with.html'>here</a>)</li>
<li>If you don't want it to be restarted, return <code>START_NOT_STICKY</code> instead</li>
<li>Here is an example using <code>START_STICKY</code>:
<pre>
 override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
        
    // do something, e.g. start GPS, or music playing, etc.

    return START_STICKY // Important if you want service to be restarted!

}
</pre>
</li>
<li>If the service is restarted due to previously being killed because of low memory, the <code>intent</code> parameter will be null (again, see <a href='https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/02/service-api-changes-starting-with.html'>here</a>; otherwise, this is the intent used to start the service)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Stopping a service and overriding onDestroy()</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's possible that you want your activity to <em>stop</em> a service at any time</li> 
<li>To do this you can call <code>stopService()</code> with the same Intent used to start the service, for example:
<pre>stopService(serviceIntent)</pre>
</li>
<li>When a service is stopped, the <code>onDestroy()</code> method of the service will be called. In <em>the Service's <code>onDestroy()</code></em>, you must stop any threads, background tasks, etc. that the Service is running, as otherwise, the thread will continue to run after its parent Service has been destroyed, resulting in possible memory leaks and unintended behaviour</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Binding a service</h3>
<p>While starting a service is best for long running services, it
has the disadvantage that you will not have a reference to the Service in the Activity.  If you want to be able to easily control your Service from your Activity, there are two main approaches:
	<ul>
	<li>Using <em>broadcasts</em>. This is discussed later.</li>
	<li><em>Bind</em> the service. This gives you a reference to the service from the activity, which you can then use to control the service.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>We will first look at <em>binding</em> the service. You must bind it instead of, or in addition to, starting the service (see <a href='https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html'>the Android documentation</a> for more details).</p>
<p>Binding a service is a little trickier than starting it as you need to provide a <code>Binder</code> object. This is an interface to the service which gives the outside world (e.g. the activity) access to it. The <code>Binder</code> object is an object which inherits from <code>android.os.Binder</code>. 
<p>The Activity is able to access the Binder (see below) and, as long as the Binder has a method which returns the Service, can obtain the Service. Thus, the Binder should provide a method to return the service.</p>
<p>As seen above, you must also provide an <code>onBind()</code> method within the Service to create a new Binder object and return it when the Activity binds to the service. Remember that <strong>you need this method even if you do not intend to use binding, but it can return <code>null</code> in that case.</strong>
</p>
<p>A common pattern is to have the Binder as an inner class of the Service (an inner class is a class within another class)</p>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Architecture of binding</h4>
<p>To bind a service, we need two more components, a <code>Binder</code> (as we have seen) and a <code>ServiceConnection</code>, which is used to provide a connection between the activity and the service, and is discussed further below. 
The architecture of binding a service, showing the <code>Binder</code> and <code>ServiceConnection</code>, is shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/service_bind.png" alt="Binding a service" />
</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
Here is an example.
(Note that <code>IBinder</code> is an interface which <code>Binder</code> implements).
<pre>
class MusicService: Service() {
    inner class MusicServiceBinder(val musicService: MusicService): android.os.Binder()

    override fun onBind(intent:Intent) : IBinder {
        return MusicServiceBinder(this)
    }
}
</pre>
Note the following:
<ul>
<li>The service contains a binder as an inner class. An instance of the binder is created, and returned, in the <code>onBind()</code> method. This method runs when the activity binds to it.</li>
<li>The binder has a reference to the service <em>within it</em>, i.e. <code>musicService</code>. This is needed as the activity will receive only the binder, not the service. Thus, if the activity wants the service, it must obtain it from the binder.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>The ServiceConnection</h4>
<p>As we have seen, in our activity, we must create a <code>ServiceConnection</code> object, to obtain a connection to the service. Here is an example - this might go in your <code>onCreate()</code>:
<pre>
 val serviceConn = object: ServiceConnection {
     override fun onServiceConnected(name: ComponentName?, binder: IBinder?) {
        service = (binder as MusicService.MusicServiceBinder).musicService
     }

     override fun onServiceDisconnected(name: ComponentName?) {
     }
 }
</pre>
It is an instance of an <em>anonymous class</em> (a class with no name, which inherits from the abstract class <code>ServiceConnection</code> and overrides the required methods on-the-fly. These methods are:
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>onServiceConnected()</code> method is a callback method which runs as soon as the Activity has been bound to the Service. The Binder object (the inner class within our Service, see above) is provided as a parameter to <code>onServiceConnected()</code>, so we cast it to the correct object (<code>MusicService.MusicServiceBinder</code>) and obtain our Service using its <code>service</code> attribute.</li>

<li><code>onServiceDisconnected()</code> runs when the service is disconnected from the activity. Here, we're not doing anything in the method but we still need to override it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Using <code>bindService()</code> to initiate the binding</h4>
<p>Finally, In your main activity, you bind the service using <code>bindService()</code>
which, like <code>startService()</code> takes an Intent for the Service.
<pre>
val bindIntent = Intent(this, MusicService::class.java);
bindService(bindIntent, serviceConn,  Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE)
</pre>
This will bind the activity to the service and trigger the onBind() method in the MusicService. The Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE flag will "automatically create the service as long as the binding exists" (see <a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html'>here</a>), without this flag, you will also need to call <code>startService()</code> to start the service.</p>
</div>


<div>
<h4>Unbinding</h4>
<ul>
<li>
When an Activity is destroyed (i.e. when <code>onDestroy()</code> is called), you should call <code>unbindService()</code> to let Android know that the activity does not wish to be connected anymore.</li>
<li> By default, the service will be destroyed if no activities are currently connected to it</li>
<li><code>unbindService()</code> takes the ServiceConnection as an argument</li>
<li>e.g.:
<pre>
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    unbindService(gpsServiceConn)
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Starting and binding</h3>
<ul>
<li>What if we wish to bind a service, but want the service to keep going even if an Activity is not running?</li>
<li>This would be the case in both a music player and a GPS recorder, in which we want a GPS track to record even if the activity shuts down</li>
<li>In this case, we need to call both <code>startService()</code> and <code>bindService()</code>.</li>
<li>This will have the effect both of creating a long-lasting service (which will continue until the service has done its work) - this is enabled with <code>startService()</code> - and allowing the activity to control the service - this is done with <code>bindService()</code>.</li>
<li>You should still call <code>unbindService()</code> when the activity is destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div>
<h2>Broadcasts</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Broadcasts</em> allow us to use Intents to send information between components, and components can also <em>listen</em> to broadcasts. These components may belong to <em>completely different applications</em> or <em>the same application</em></li>
<li>Using broadcasts allows for clean, easy to understand, loosely-coupled
components</li>
<li>A broadcast is an <code>Intent</code> and as such can pass data to another
application component as a <code>Bundle</code></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>BroadcastReceiver</h3>
<ul>
<li>To receive a broadcast in a component, we need to 
create a <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> object</li>
<li>A BroadcastReceiver can receive intents and act upon them 
according to the intent's <code>action</code></li>
<li>To use a BroadcastReceiver you must also use an
<code>IntentFilter</code></li>
<li>An IntentFilter allows you to control which intents an 
application component can receive</li>
<li>Intents which do not match the filter will be ignored</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Example of sending a broadcast</h3>
<pre>
val broadcast = Intent().apply {
    action = "sendTime"
    putExtra("time", System.currentTimeMillis())
}
sendBroadcast(broadcast)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>We are creating an <code>intent</code> with an <code>action</code> of <code>sendTime</code></li>
<li>The intent contains an extra, <code>time</code>, containing the current time in 
milliseconds since Jan 1st 1970</li>
<li>We then use <code>sendBroadcast()</code> to send the Intent as a broadcast</li>
<li>This might typically be placed in a <code>Service</code> (so that the Service can broadcast updates to one or more activities) but could equally well be placed in any application component, such as an activity</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Receiving a broadcast</h3>
<ul>
<li>This code, typically appearing in an Activity, shows a broadcast receiver:
<pre>
receiver = object:BroadcastReceiver() {
    override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {
         when (intent?.action) {
                "sendTime" -&gt; toast("${intent?.getLongExtra("time", 0)}")
            }
        }
 }
</pre>
</li>
<li>We then need to set up an <code>IntentFilter</code> in our activity to explicitly state
that this activity is capable of receiving intents with an action of <code>sendTime</code>:
<pre>
val filter = IntentFilter().apply {
    addAction("sendTime")
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Note how we first check that the intent's action is indeed
<code>sendTime</code>. Even though this is specified by the
intent filter, it is recommended to do this as "it is possible for senders
to force delivery to specific recipients, bypassing filter resolution"
(see <a href='https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html#onReceive(android.content.Context, android.content.Intent)'>the documentation</a>)</li>
 <li>We then <em>register the receiver</em> with the Activity (or whatever application
component is receiving it), specifying both receiver and intent filter:
<pre>ContextCompat.registerReceiver(this, receiver, intentFilter, ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED)</pre>
</li>
<li><code>ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED</code> specifies that we cannot receive broadcasts from <strong>other apps</strong>, which is useful for security. In theory, an app could send a malicious broadcast to another app which could have harmful side effects, so if we don't need inter-app communication when receiving broadcasts, we should turn it off.</li>
<li>We use <code>ContextCompat</code> because we are using the <em>compatibility</em> version of the call; <code>RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED</code> was only introduced in API 33. The <em>compatibility</em> (<code>appcompat</code>) library allows us to use newer API features on older versions of Android.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Unregistering a broadcast receiver</h3>
<ul>
<li>A broadcast receiver must be <em>unregistered</em> on shutdown of the component receiving it</li>
<li>This would typically go in <code>onDestroy()</code></li>
<li>e.g.
<pre>override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    unregisterReceiver(receiver)
}</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Important point - it might take some time to asynchronously start a service</h3>

<p>It's important to note that <em>it might take time to start a service</em>. The process of starting a service takes place asynchronously and might take time to complete. This has important implications if you do something in the main activity (such as testing whether a permission has been granted) while waiting for the service to start. You might, for example, send a broadcast to tell the service to start listening for GPS updates as soon as the permissions have been checked. But at this stage (if the user does not need to explicitly grant permission via the dialog) the service may not have been started yet, so there will be no service to broadcast to! Consequently, your broadcast intent will go un-noticed.</p>

<p>A way round this is to send a broadcast <em>from the service to the activity</em> as soon as <code>onStartCommand()</code> has completed. This then tells the activity that the service is started, and ready to receive broadcasts. So as a result, the activity can then check permissions <strong>when this broadcast has been received from the service.</strong></p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>You are going to write a stopwatch application using services and broadcasts. The idea is to develop a front end allowing the user to start, stop and reset a stopwatch via buttons on the UI. The stopwatch should be controlled by a service. Each button (start, stop and reset) on the UI should send a <em>broadcast</em> to the service, and the service should act accordingly.</p>

<ul>

<li>You'll need this extra dependency in your <code>build.gradle.kts</code>:
<pre>implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-service:2.7.0")</pre>
This allows you to launch coroutines from the service. If you are using an older version of Android Studio it's possible that you'll have to use an earlier version than 2.7.0; if you encounter problems, try reducing it by one version e.g. 2.6.0, 2.5.0 etc.</li>

<li>In order to launch coroutines from the service, you'll need your service to inherit from <code>androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleService</code></li>

<li>The service should contain a variable <code>count</code>, an integer which increases by one every second (see below).</li>

<li>The <code>onStartCommand()</code> in the service should launch a coroutine which should include a loop which loops until the service is destroyed. This can be done by using a boolean which is set to false in <code>onDestroy()</code>.</li>

<li>In the coroutine, switch context to <code>Dispatchers.IO</code> and in here, call <code>delay()</code> with a parameter of 1000 (milliseconds). This will pause the coroutine but in the background context so the UI does not become unresponsive. After the <code>delay()</code>, increase the counter by one. The code would look something like this:

<pre>
lifecycleScope.launch {
    // ... other code ...

    withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        delay(1000)
        // increase counter...
    }
}
</pre>

<li>Implement a broadcast receiver in the service to implement the logic for the Start, Stop and Reset operations. The first two can be handled with a boolean variable and the Reset can be handled by resetting the counter to 0.</li>

<li>When the counter increases by one, send a broadcast back to the main activity containing the value of the counter. Receive the broadcast in the main activity by showing the value of the counter in the UI. You will also need a <code>ViewModel</code> containing the counter as <code>LiveData</code> to implement this.</li>

<li>Implement code to pause the stopwatch when the activity becomes invisible (but still running, e.g. the user navigates to the home screen), and restart it when the activity becomes visible again. You'll need to look at the <em>lifecycle</em> notes in order to work out how to do this.</li>

</ul>
