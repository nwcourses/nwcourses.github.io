<h3>The Android Activity Lifecycle</h3>
<p>To understand Android development more fully it is useful to have
understanding of the <em>Android activity lifecycle</em>.</p>
<p>Mobile apps are not quite like standard desktop applications. In particular,
<em>the application may be interrupted</em>, most commonly by the user
answering a phone call. Also, users commonly switch from one app to another.
Unless the user quits the app using the "back" button, when this happens
<em>the original app is still runningin the background</em>.</p>
<p> 
To manage these possiblities, Android activities have a defined 
<em>lifecycle</em>. The idea is to code activities to respond to the different
points in the lifecycle. The lifecycle consists of a series of methods which run
one after the other, as follows. When coding your app, you override whichever
methods you want specific behaviour to occur at. With practically every
activity, this includes <code>onCreate()</code>, but your activity might need
to override the others too.

<p>It is described in full
on the Android website, 
<a href='http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle'>
here</a>.</p>
<p>
The original article describes the lifecycle in full but to summarise,
the following methods run when certain events occur:
    <ul>
    <li><code><em>onCreate()</em></code>: runs when the application is first launched.
    Note also that certain actions, such as changing the device orientation,
    can force <em>onCreate()</em> to run.</li>
    <li><code><em>onStart()</em></code> and <code>onResume()</code>: both run when the activity becomes visible. This can either be when it first becomes visible, or becomes visible again after being hidden. For example, it will be called
    after you return to the current Activity after using a completely different application, or after closing a second activity within the same application, e.g. a
    preferences screen, causing the original activity to become visible again.
    See the discussion of <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onStop()</code>, below, for the difference between the two.</li>
    <li><code><em>onPause()</em></code>: when the activity pauses after being fully visible, and focused. This happens on shutdown of the activity, or when another activity comes in front of the current activity, <strong>including activities not occupying the whole of the screen.</strong></li>
    <li><code><em>onStop()</em></code>: is called immediately after <code>onPause()</code> but <em>only</em> on shutdown, or if the activity coming in front of the current one <strong>occupies the whole of the screen</strong>. </li>
    <li><code>onResume()</code> is the opposite of <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onStart()</code> is the opposite of <code>onStop()</code>. Thus, <code>onResume()</code> is called when the current activity becomes visible and focused again after removing an activity in front of it (or when launching the activity), <strong>including cases where the activity on top of the current activity, which has just been removed, does not occupy the whole of the screen</strong>. By contrast, <em>onStart()</em> is only called either on startup or when the activity on top of the current activity, now being removed, occupies the whole of the screen.</li> 
<li><em>onDestroy()</em>: runs when the user dismisses the application. This will happen
    when the user presses the Back button from the main activity. It can also be called under other
    circumstances, e.g. Android kills the activity due to low memory, or when the user rotates the
    device.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The lifecycle can have important consequences for development. For example, in a mapping app you might want to stop GPS communication when the activity becomes invisible and start it again when it becomes visible again (to save battery), in which case you would stop the GPS in <em>onPause()</em> and start it in <em>onResume()</em>. If you did this in <em>onDestroy()</em> and <em>onCreate()</em> instead, the GPS would still be running if the activity was running but invisible, which for a mapping app would be unnecessary.</p>
<p>The differences between <code>onStart()</code>/<code>onStop()</code> and <code>onResume()</code>/<code>onPause()</code> are quite subtle and need only be considered if you are writing activities which do not occupy the whole of the screen, which is not so common. Generally, <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onResume()</code> are more commonly used.</p>
