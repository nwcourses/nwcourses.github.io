<h3>Application resources</h3>
<p>Android apps consist of Kotlin or Java code plus <em>resources</em> - additional data which the app needs to do its job. An example of a resource is an XML layout file, as described above. Resources can be found within <em>res</em>, as we saw above.</p>
<p>Within the <em>res</em> folder is a <em>layout</em> folder, and within that is the <em>activity_main.xml</em> which is auto-generated when you start a new Android project: it is basically a default main view for your main Activity. You replaced it with code to manually create a TextView object above.  However, now you are going to change it back to reading the layout from the XML file. Replace (or comment out) the code you wrote above with this code (which was in the
original auto-generated code for your main Activity):
<pre>setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)</pre>
Run your app again and you will see that this message now appears:
<pre>Hello World!</pre>
Where is this message coming from? Remember that in the <em>activity_main.xml</em> file, the <em>android:text</em> attribute of the TextView describes the text on the TextView and this is set to the value <em>@string/hello</em>. What does <em>@string/hello</em> represent? It is a <em>string resource</em>. In Android development, to make it easier to translate apps into different languages, much of the text that we see within the user interface is defined in a <em>string resource file</em> so that we can easily translate an app to a different language simply by editing the string resource file. This can be found within the <em>values</em> folder within <em>res</em>, in the file <em>strings.xml</em>.  If you look in the <em>strings.xml</em> file, you will see this line:<pre><code>&lt;string name="hello"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre>
Change this to:<pre><code>&lt;string name="hello"&gt;Geia sas Kosmos!&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre>
(Sorry if I have got the Greek wrong!). 
Run your app again, and you should find it greets you with <em>Geia sas Kosmos!</em> Notice how each string in the <em>strings.xml</em>
file has a <em>name</em>, and we reference that name in the layout file with
<em>android:text="@string/(name of string)"</em>.</p>
<p>As well as layout and strings, the <em>res</em> folder can contain other types of resource. These include application menus (which we will come onto a bit later on) and images. When you distribute an app, all the resources are packed into one file along with your actual code.</p>
<h3>The auto-generated R.java file</h3>
<p>You might be a bit puzzled as to the meaning of the <em>R</em> in the code you added above, i.e.
<pre>setContentView(R.layout.main);</pre>
What, actually, is this "R"? It's a pre-generated Java class which contains "hooks" into your XML resource files. The <em>R.java</em> file, not directly accessible from Studio but present in your project, looks something like this:<pre><code>/* AUTO-GENERATED FILE.  DO NOT MODIFY.
 *
 * This class was automatically generated by the
 * aapt tool from the resource data it found.  It
 * should not be modified by hand.
 */

package com.example.nickw.helloworld;

public final class R {
    public static final class attr {
    }
    public static final class drawable {
        public static final int icon=0x7f020000;
    }
    public static final class layout {
        public static final int activity_main=0x7f030000;
    }
    public static final class string {
        public static final int app_name=0x7f040001;
        public static final int hello=0x7f040000;
    }
}
</code></pre>
</pre>
Notice that it contains several static variables. These are identifiers which your Kotlin or Java code can use to access the XML, for example <em>R.layout.activity_main</em> has the hex value <em>0x7f030000</em> which is a "handle" for the activity_main.xml resource file. Every time you add a resource to an Android app, your <em>R.java</em> will automatically be updated and you will be able to use static attributes of <em>R</em> in your Java code to access different resources. Never edit R.java directly by the way, the system will always do it for you!
