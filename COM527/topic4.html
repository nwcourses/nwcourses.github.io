<h1>MAD Topic 4 : XML Layouts, Views and Introduction to Mapping</h1>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As you have seen in Weeks 2 and 3, <em>Jetpack Compose</em> is recommended as the contemporary standard in UI development. However you may still be exposed to the older approach to developing UIs using <em>XML layouts</em> and <em>Views</em>, so we will look at it here. In particular, you may find yourself working with other people's code, or third-party libraries, which uses this approach. Due to its use of <em>Views</em> (to be discussed below), this approach is know as the <em>Views</em> approach to UI development.</li>
<h2>Views and XML Layouts</h2>
<h3>Views</h3>
<p>The <em>View</em> is the single most important concept in Views UI development. A <em>View</em> represents a visible component on the screen, such as a button, a text field or a label. <code>View</code> is an Android API class and all Views UI components are sub-classes of <code>View</code>, for example a Views <code>Button</code> (different to the Compose <code>Button</code>) is a subclass of <code>View</code>.</p>
<p> Every Views Activity contains a View which is the "main component" of the screen, referred to as the <em>content view</em>. This is normally, but not always, a parent <code>View</code> which contains a series of other <code>View</code>s. In the example below, it's the simplest type of View: a <code>TextView</code>. A TextView is what it sounds like: a View which can contain text. So here, we create a TextView containing the text "Hello world" and make it the content view of our Activity.
<pre>
package com.example.myapp
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.widget.TextView

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        val tv = TextView(this)
        tv.setText("Hello World!")
        setContentView(tv)
    }
}</pre>
</p>
<h3>XML Layouts</h3>
<p>In Views development, we frequently we add components to the main screen programatically, as seen above. However we can cut down on the amount of setup code using <em>XML layouts</em> instead. With XML layouts, we define the layout of the content view of the Activity using <em>XML</em> tags. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a tag-based format for representing data, related to HTML.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of an XML based layout:<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"&gt;
&lt;TextView android:layout_width="wrap_content" 
android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:text="@string/hello" /&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>
To explain this:
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>LinearLayout</code> defines the view's layout. The layout specifies how the various components are arranged with respect to each other. LinearLayout indicated that components are placed adjacent to each other, either vertically or horizontally (depending on the <code>android:orientation</code> attribute)</li>

    <li>We then add a TextView tag. Basically every Android UI class has corresponding tag of the same name.</li>
    <li>The <code>android:layout_width</code> and <code>android:layout_height</code> attributes of the <code>TextView</code> describe how it fills its parent layout in the horizontal and vertical directions.  The most common values are <code>match_parent</code> and <code>wrap_content</code>. The former, as used here, means that the TextView entirely fills its parent (the LinearLayout), the result being that the TextView fills the entire screen.  The latter,<code>wrap_content</code>, means that <em>enough space to contain the content</em> (the text "Hello World" here) should be used.  </li>
    <li>The <code>android:text</code> attribute specifies the text within the TextView.  Note however how we don't give it a straight value, we use <code>@string/hello</code>, which will represent an entry with a <code>name</code> of <code>hello</code> in the <code>strings.xml</code> file.
    </ul>
Where should the XML file be placed? It is found in the <em>application resources</em>,  which we have discussed already. Specifically it should be placed in the <code>layout</code> resources folder. If you create a <em>Views Activity</em> when choosing the project type in Android Studio, it will create a layout file, <code>activity_main.xml</code>, for you.</p>
<p>As for other types of resource you access this through the auto-generated <code>R</code> class. So assuming the XML layout is in <code>activity_main.xml</code>, you can set the XML layout as the main content view of your activity with:
<pre>setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)</pre>
The complete code would be as follows:
<pre>
package com.example.myapp
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    }
}</pre>
</p>
<h3>Event handling with Views activities</h3>
<p>Here is an example of how events are handled in Views activities. It's the feet-to-metres exercise, but re-written for Views. Firstly, the XML layout:
<pre>&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"&gt;

 &lt;EditText
    android:layout_width="match_parent" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:inputType="numberDecimal"
    android:id="@+id/et1" /&gt;

 &lt;Button 
    android:layout_width="wrap_content" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:id="@+id/btn1" 
    android:text="@string/convertBtn" /&gt;

 &lt;TextView 
    android:layout_width="match_parent" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:id="@+id/tv1"/&gt;

&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</pre>
Note how this linear layout consists of an <code>EditText</code> (equivalent to a <code>TextField</code> in Compose), a <code>Button</code> and a <code>TextView</code>. Because the <code>orientation</code> of the <code>LinearLayout</code> is vertical, the elements will be stacked on top of each other (like a <code>Column</code> in Compose).</p>
<p>Note also how each element has an <em>ID</em>. This allows us to access it from within Kotlin, rather like how we can access HTML elements from JavaScript using their ID.</p>
<p>Here is the Kotlin code to interact with the elements in the layout. When the <code>Button</code> is pressed, it reads the feet from the <code>EditText</code> as a string, converts it to a double, converts it to metres and place the metres in the <code>TextView</code>.
<pre>import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.widget.Button
import android.view.View.OnClickListener
import android.view.View
import android.widget.TextView
import android.widget.EditText

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity () {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)        
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        val b = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.btn1)
        b.setOnClickListener {
            val et1 = findViewById&lt;EditText&gt;(R.id.et1)
            val feet = et1.text.toString().toDouble()
            val metres = feet*0.305
            val tv1 = findViewById&lt;TextView&gt;(R.id.tv1)
            tv1.text = "In metres that is: $metres"
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>First of all note how we access the user interface components from Kotlin. We use code such as:
<pre>val b = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.btn1)</pre>
Note how the <code>findViewById()</code> method takes in an ID and returns the corresponding component. The ID matches the IDs that we specified in the XML file; for instance, our button was given an ID of <code>btn1</code> so we reference it in code with <code>R.id.btn1</code>.</p>
<h3>Event handling</h3>
<p>To handle events such as button clicks, we specify an <em>event listener</em> function, which is typically a lambda. For a button, the event listener is specified with <code>setOnClickListener()</code>:
<pre>
b.setOnClickListener {
    val et1 = findViewById&lt;EditText&gt;(R.id.et1)
    val feet = et1.text.toString().toDouble()
    val metres = feet*0.305
    val tv1 = findViewById&lt;TextView&gt;(R.id.tv1)
    tv1.text = "In metres that is: $metres"
}
</pre>
When the button is clicked, the specified lambda function will run, and
as you can see, the lambda first obtains the edit text
element, and then reads the feet from it with
<pre>val feet = et1.text.toString().toDouble()</pre>
Note that the <code>.text</code> property of the edit text returns an object of type <code>Editable</code>. We then need to call <code>toString()</code> on the Editable to get the actual text out of the text field, and finally convert it to a <code>Double</code> using <code>toDouble()</code>.</p>
<p>Then we convert the feet to metres and place the result in the TextView.</p> 
<h2>Using Views from Jetpack Compose</h2>
<p>Because Jetpack Compose is quite a recent development, there are many third-party libraries which use Views rather than Compose. You may want to use these libraries while still using Compose for your UI. You can do this with the <code>AndroidView</code> composable. <code>AndroidView</code> is used to make a composable from an existing <code>View</code>. We will look at the use of <code>AndroidView</code> a little later, but first we will take a look at <em>mapping</em> in Android apps. The mapping library that we are looking at makes use of Views, so it provides a perfect example of how to integrate Views-based libraries into a Compose application.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Mapping</h2>
<h3>Application builds - examining the build.gradle.kts file</h3>
<p>Android projects use the build tool <a href='https://gradle.org'>Gradle</a> to build an executable Android app from your source code and resources. Gradle is rather like Maven, which most of you have met in OODD. Gradle uses a build file <em>build.gradle.kts</em> to tell it how to build the project. We are now going to take a first look at the app's <em>build.gradle.kts</em> file and examine how to include <em>third-party dependencies</em> (i.e. libraries).</p>
<h4>Including third-party dependencies</h4>
<p>Many Android apps depend on <em>third-party libraries</em> written by independent developers. Many of these are FOSS (free and open-source software) meaning, amongst other things, you can use them freely in your own projects. Dependencies are added to the <em>build.gradle.kts</em> file.</p>
<p>You should link third-party dependencies to your app via the <em>dependencies</em> section of the <em>build.gradle.kts</em> file. <em>build.gradle.kts</em> is a build file: a set of instructions used by <em>Gradle</em> to create your app from your code and any third-party libraries it may require. Gradle is a standalone tool (can be used outside Android Studio, so you can build your apps with Gradle and without Studio if you wish), but is included within Android Studio.</p>
<p>Note there are two <em>build.gradle.kts</em> files, one for the whole project and one for your app specifically. It is the latter (the <em>app</em> build.gradle; the <em>second</em> one as seen in Android Studio) that you need to edit in most cases. The <em>dependencies</em> section of an app build.gradle.kts is shown below.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/buildgradle_dependencies.png" alt="app build.gradle.kts file - dependencies" />
</p>
<p>To use mapping, we need to include a third-party mapping library,
specifically <em>osmdroid</em>.</p>
<p>We are going to add the <em>osmdroid</em> mapping library to our app as an example of a dependency. This will allow us to add a map to our main activity. It can be added to the <code>dependencies</code> section of the app's <em>build.gradle.kts</em> as an additional dependency:
<pre>
<strong>implementation</strong> ("org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:6.1.17")
</pre>
</p>
<p>Where is the osmdroid library coming from? If you have used a build system
such as Maven in standard Java, you might recognise the technique used. It
downloads the osmdroid library from an <em>online repository of Java
libraries</em>. There are two repositories used: Google's own, and <a href="https://search.maven.org">Maven Central</a>, the standard one Maven also uses. Additional repositories can be specified in the <code>settings.gradle.kts</code> file.</p>
<p> Once the dependency has been
downloaded, it will be saved on your computer so that it will not need to
be downloaded next time you open the project.</p>
<h3>More on osmdroid</h3>
<p>Most location-based apps include a map as the content view of their main activity.  Android comes with inbuilt map functionality via Google Maps; however to use Google Maps you need to obtain an API key and it comes with some restrictions so we are going to use an alternative mapping library: <em>osmdroid</em>, available <a href='http://www.github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid'>here</a>. (A <em>library</em> is a collection of Java classes with related functionality, such as mapping). As a Java library, you can use it in a Kotlin app.</p>
<p>osmdroid is a third-party open source library which uses
maps from the <a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a> project. OpenStreetMap is a global
project to provide free and open mapping data which anyone can contribute to;
see <a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>the website</a> for more details. In using
osmdroid, you will also see how to add external libraries to an Android project.
</p>
<h3>Latitude and Longitude</h3>
<p>In order to understand location-based applications, it is important
to understand the coordinate system used on the earth. The most common
coordinate system uses <em>latitude and longitude</em>. Latitude is a measure
of how far north or south you are: the equator is at 0 degrees,
while the North Pole is at 90 degrees North, we are at about 50 and Spain
is at about 40. Longitude is a measure of how far east or west you are:
0 degrees of longitude is referred to as the <em>Prime Meridian</em>
(or <em>Greenwich Meridian</em>) and passes through Greenwich, London. 
By contrast Germany is located
between approximately 7 degrees and 15 degrees East, while New York is at
74 degrees West and the west coast of North America at approximately 120
degrees West.</p>
<p><img src="../images/latlon.png" alt="Latitude and longitude" /></p>
<p>So a given point on the earth can be defined via its latitude and
longitude. The university is at approximately, 50.9 North (latitude) and 1.4 West (longitude). By convention, latitudes north of the equator and longitudes
east of Greenwich are treated as positive, so we can also define our
position as <strong>longitude -1.4, latitude +50.9</strong>.</p>
<h3>Mapping code</h3>
<p>Here is a sample app using the osmdroid Android API using Views.
<pre>
package com.example.mapping

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.preference.PreferenceManager
import org.osmdroid.config.Configuration
import org.osmdroid.tileprovider.tilesource.TileSourceFactory
import org.osmdroid.util.GeoPoint
import org.osmdroid.views.MapView

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // This line sets the user agent, a requirement to download OSM maps
        Configuration.getInstance().load(this, PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this));

        val map1 = MapView(this) 
        map1.controller.setCenter(GeoPoint(51.05, -0.72))
        map1.controller.setZoom(14.0)
        map1.setClickable(true)
        map1.setTileSource(TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK)
        setContentView(map1)
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how this is working:
<ul>
<li>We create a <code>MapView</code> object. This is a View representing the map.</li>
<li>The remaining code is actually quite straightforward. We set the    
zoom level (14; higher numbers are zoomed in further) 
and the centre point of the map, in latitude and longitude. We also make the map clickable (so the user can interact with it) and set the <em>tile source</em> (the source of the map; osmdroid can use many different maps). Here we are using a MAPNIK map, which is the default style of OpenStreetMap map.
For more on zoom levels, see 
<a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/coordinates'>Google's article on zoom levels</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Using <code>apply()</code></h4>
<p>Note how we repeatedly refer to the <code>map1</code> object when calling the methods to set the map properties. This arguably makes the code a little repetitive. We can avoid this with a <em><code>apply()</code></em> call. <code>apply()</code> allows us to define a lambda, inside which <code>this</code> refers to a particular object. So we could use, in this case, <code>this.setCenter()</code>, <code>this.setZoom()</code> etc. However, because <code>this</code> is optional when calling methods, we could simply use <code>setCenter()</code> and <code>setZoom()</code>. Here is an example of the code above rewritten to use <code>apply()</code>:
<pre>
val map1 = MapView(this) 
map1.apply {
    controller.setCenter(GeoPoint(51.05, -0.72))
    controller.setZoom(14.0)
    setClickable(true)
    setTileSource(TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK)
}
setContentView(map1)
</pre>
Note how <code>map1</code> is the subject of the <code>apply()</code> call. So inside the <code>apply()</code> lambda, <code>this</code> refers to the <code>map1</code> object. But, as said above, we can omit <code>this</code> and write the method calls without any object.
</p>
<h3>The manifest file and Permissions</h3>
<p>Mapping apps need to obtain the map tiles from the internet. To do this, we need to add the <em>internet permission</em>. The manifest file is an XML file describing the app and its components (e.g. the activities making up the app), as well as the app <em>permissions</em> (see below). It is called <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> and can be found in the <code>manifests</code> directory.</p>
<p>Apps need to be granted <em>permissions</em> to perform sensitive 
operations. Sensitive operations can include:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Using the internet</em> - because this might incur a cost to
    the user, and have potential privacy/security concerns;</li>
    <li><em>Tracking your location</em> - because this could be potentially
    abused (e.g. by stalkers)</li>
    <li><em>Reading from and writing to files</em> - again this has
    security concerns.</li>    
    </ul>
</p>
<p>We will look at permissions in more detail next time. For now, we just
need to add one permission to the manifest file:
    <ul>
    <li>INTERNET - needed to download the maps from the internet</li>
    </ul>
So ensure your manifest file contains the following permissions. They should
go <strong>before the &lt;application&gt; tag.</strong>
<pre>
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Back to using Views from Compose: Creating a Map Composable</h2>
<p>Having now looked at mapping, we can create a Composable to contain an osmdroid map as an example of using Views in Compose. How do we do this in general?
We make use of the <code>AndroidView</code> composable. This is a composable designed precisely for the purpose of including Views inside a Compose layout. When creating an <code>AndroidView</code> you should specify two parameters:    
    <ul>
    <li>The <em><code>factory</code></em>. This is a function which should create and return the View you wish to include in the Compose layout, such as a <code>MapView</code>.</li>
    <li>The <em><code>update</code></em> function. This code is called whenever the composable is re-rendered, for example because state changes. In here you would set any properties of the View that might need to change.</li>
    </ul>
Here is an example <code>MapComposable</code> which is a composable wrapping a <code>MapView</code>:
<pre>
@Composable
fun MapComposable(geoPoint: GeoPoint) {

    AndroidView(
        factory = { ctx -&gt;
            // This line sets the user agent, a requirement to download OSM maps
            Configuration.getInstance()
                .load(ctx, PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(ctx))

            MapView(ctx).apply {
                setClickable(true)
                setMultiTouchControls(true)
                setTileSource(TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK)
                controller.setZoom(14.0)
            }
        },

        update = { view -&gt;
            view.controller.setCenter(geoPoint)
        }
    )
}
</pre>
This might be used from our main layout as follows. Note how we are storing the current latitude and longitude (a <code>GeoPoint</code>) in state:
<pre>setContent {
    MappingComposeTheme {
        Surface {
            var geoPoint: GeoPoint by remember { mutableStateOf(GeoPoint(51.05, -0.72)) }
            MapComposable(geoPoint)
        }
    }
}</pre>
Note how the <code>MapComposable</code> contains an <code>AndroidView</code>. To explore the <code>AndroidView</code> in more detail:
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>factory</code>, a lambda, is run when the layout is first created. It takes one parameter <code>ctx</code>. This is a <code>Context</code>, a standard Android class which represents primary application components such as Activities. Here, the context <code>ctx</code> will represent the activity, but it can represent other components in some situations. The context is typically needed for creating the View: note how we pass it into the <code>MapView</code> in this case.</li>
    <li>Note how we create the MapView and call <code>apply()</code> to set its properties. However we <em>do not store it in a variable</em> as we automatically obtain a reference to it in the <code>update</code> method (see below).</li>        <li>Remember that the <em>final statement in a lambda represents the return value</em>. Here, the code to create the <code>MapView</code> is the final statement in the lambda, so the <code>MapView</code> will be returned from the factory in this case. This is what we must do: <strong>we must return the View from the factory function.</strong></li>
    <li>Note also the <code>update</code> parameter. This is also a function: this function runs each time a composable is re-rendered, for example the state changes. In here, you make changes to the underlying View which may need to be made if the state changes. The <code>update</code> function takes the View that we returned from the <code>factory</code> as a parameter (<code>view</code> in the example), so here the parameter will represent the MapView. In this example, we might store the current latitude and longitude in state, in a <code>GeoPoint</code> object. This object is passed into our <code>MapComposable</code> from state, so will change when the state changes.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>Before attempting these exercises, ensure that you complete <strong>Exercise 1 and the lists exercise from last week</strong>. You do not, however, have to complete the advanced (messaging) exercise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a simple Views application containing an <code>EditText</code>, <code>Button</code> and <code>TextView</code>. The <code>EditText</code> should allow the user to enter their name. When the user clicks the button, the <code>TextView</code> should greet the user by name by displaying "Hello" plus the name entered in the <code>EditText</code>. Use the feet to metres Views examples, above, for guidance.</li>
<li>Try out the simple Views-based mapping example above.</li>
<li>Using <code>AndroidView</code>, create a working Compose application showing an osmdroid map. Position it to latitude 50.9, longitude -1.4.</li>
<li>You are now going to make the map application more interesting by allowing the user to enter a latitude and longitude in two <code>TextField</code>s. Create a Compose layout with:
	<ul>
	<li>a row at the top, containing the two text fields and a button;</li>
	<li>your map composable (from question 2) occupying the rest of the screen space.</li>
	</ul>
The intended layout is shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/map_controls_at_top.png" alt="Map layout with controls at top" />
<br />
The application should include these state variables:
	<ul>
	<li>most recently entered latitude and longitude (both strings);</li>
	<li>current position (a <code>GeoPoint</code> - part of osmdroid).</li>
	<li>When the user enters a latitude and longitude in the text fields, the latitude or longitude (as appropriate) state variable should be updated. When the user clicks the button, the <code>GeoPoint</code> should be updated appropriately.</li>
	<li>Ensure the map updates when the <code>GeoPoint</code> changes.</li>
	<li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Read ahead on the <code>Box</code> composable in <a href='topic5.html'>Topic 5</a> and try altering the layout so that the row containing the text fields and buttons is at the <em>bottom</em> of the screen. The intended layout is as follows:
<br />
<img src="../images/map_controls_at_bottom.png" alt="Map layout with controls at bottom" />
<br />
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
