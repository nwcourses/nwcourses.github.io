<h1>Mobile Application Development - Part 8</h1>
<h1>SQLite and Room</h1>
</div>
<p>This week we will look at Android <em>on-board databases</em> by taking
a look at <em>SQLite</em> and the <em>Room Persistence API</em>.</p>
<h2>Using an SQLite database in Android</h2>
<ul>
<li>Traditionally, the <em>SQLite API</em> was used to query an SQLite
database on Android</li>
<li>However, this requires a lot of repetitive "boilerplate" code to
perform queries</li>
<li>It is recommended instead to use the <strong>Room Persistence Library</strong> </li>
<li>Room is a higher-level API which takes advantage of <em>annotations</em>
to allow you to write more concise code</li>
</ul>
<h2>Annotations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Annotations are a language feature of both Java and Kotlin which allow
you to add "meta-code" which is processed before the code
is compiled</li>
<li>Annotations begin with @ followed by an annotation class name</li>
<li>Annotations are processed either by the compiler or by third-party
software</li>
</ul>
<h3>Room and annotations</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the case of Room, annotations are used to allow us to develop
more concise code</li>
<li>Room annotations consist of classes which are part of the Room library,
and are processed by the <em>Room compiler</em> into standard, albeit 
long-winded, Java code</li>
<li>This Java code is then compiled to bytecode in the normal way</li>
<li>The process is shown below:<br>
<img src="../images/room.png" alt="Room compiler and annotations"><br>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Room</h2>
<h3>Components of a Room application</h3>
<p>A Room application with one database table
would contain, as a minimum, these four classes:
</p><ul>
<li>The <em>data entity</em>: class representing your actual data, e.g
a Student class to represent a student record in a <em>students</em>
table.</li>
<li>The <em>DAO</em> or <em>Data Access Object</em>: 
    <ul>
    <li>A class providing access to your database from the rest of your
    code</li>
    <li>Contains a series of methods which perform given SQL statements</li>
    <li>e.g. a <em>getById()</em> method which will perform a SELECT statement
    to retrieve a record using its ID</li>
    <li>External code can call the methods of the DAO, and thus can be
    kept clean and uncluttered by SQL, as all the SQL code is encapsulated
    within the DAO</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>A class representing the actual <em>database</em> as a whole</li>
<li>Your main activity</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>The data entity</h3>
<ul>
<li>We'll start with the data entity</li>
<li>As seen above, this is a class representing the entities stored within
your database table</li>
<li>e.g.:
<pre> import androidx.room.Entity
import androidx.room.PrimaryKey

@Entity(tableName="students")

data class Student(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Long, 
    val name: String, 
    var course: String, 
    var mark: Int
)
</pre>
</li>
<li>This is a simple data class, but has two <em>Room annotations</em>:
    <ul>
    <li><em>@Entity</em>: specifies the database table which will be used to
    store objects that this class represents</li>
    <li><em>@PrimaryKey</em>: specifies which property will coincide with
    the primary key in the database. Note the <em>autoGenerate = true</em>
    argument, which will autogenerate the primary key as the next available
    integer.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>The columns in the table will have the same names as the properties
(i.e. id, name, course and mark)</li>
<li>We can name the columns differently to the property names in the data class using the annotation <code>@ColumnInfo</code>, e.g:
<pre> import androidx.room.Entity
import androidx.room.PrimaryKey

@Entity(tableName="students")

data class Student(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Long = 0, 
    @ColumnInfo(name="the_name") val name: String, 
    @ColumnInfo(name="the_course") var course: String, var mark: Int
)
</pre>
In this example the columns used in the actual database will be <code>the_name</code> and <code>the_course</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The DAO (Data Access Object)</h3>
<ul>
<li>As we saw above, the DAO encapsulates the SQL queries</li>
<li>Here is an example:
<pre>import androidx.room.*

@Dao
interface StudentDao {

    @Query("SELECT * FROM students WHERE id=:id")
    fun getStudentById(id: Long): Student?

    @Query("SELECT * FROM students")
    fun getAllStudents(): List&lt;Student&gt;

    @Insert
    fun insert(student: Student) : Long

    @Update
    fun update(student: Student) : Int

    @Delete
    fun delete(student: Student) : Int
}</pre>
</li>
<li>Note how:
    <ul>
    <li>The DAO is an <em>interface</em>, rather than a class: this will
    be processed by the Room compiler to provide implementations of the methods stated in the interface</li>
    <li>It's marked as a DAO by the <em>@Dao</em> annotation</li>
    <li>We specify a series of queries (using the <em>@Query</em>
    annotation) followexd by methods which will run that query</li>
    <li>For example, the <em>getStudentById()</em> method will
    execute the <em>SELECT* FROM students WHERE id=:id</em> query
    (the <em>:id</em> placeholder being bound to the <em>id</em>
    parameter passed into the method)</li>
    <li>The <em>insert()</em> method is marked with the special annotation
    <em>@Insert</em>. This will take an object of the data class and
    automatically add it to the database.</li>
    <li>As can be seen there 
    are corresponding <em>@Update</em> and <em>@Delete</em>
    annotations which will take an object and either update or delete
    the record, respectively</li>
    <li>If declared, the update and delete methods will return an int
    containing the number of affected rows</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The database object</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finally, here is the database class</li>
<li>Its role is to encapsulate the database as a whole</li>
<li>It needs to create the database object as a <em>singleton</em>
(single instance object, as we saw in OODD), to avoid creating unnecessary multiple copies of the database</li>
<li>To do this, we use Kotlin <em>companion objects</em>
    <ul>
    <li>A <em>companion object</em> is an object which is attached to
    a class as a whole, rather than specific instances of a class</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example database</h3>
<pre>import android.content.Context
import androidx.room.Database
import androidx.room.Room
import androidx.room.RoomDatabase

@Database(entities = arrayOf(Student::class), version = 1, exportSchema = false)
public abstract class StudentDatabase: RoomDatabase() {
    abstract fun studentDao(): StudentDao

    companion object {
        private var instance: StudentDatabase? = null

        fun getDatabase(ctx:Context) : StudentDatabase {
            var tmpInstance = instance
            if(tmpInstance == null) {
                tmpInstance = Room.databaseBuilder(
                    ctx.applicationContext,
                    StudentDatabase::class.java,
                    "studentDatabase"
                ).build()
                instance = tmpInstance
            }
            return tmpInstance
        }
    }
}</pre>
<h3>Example database - explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to precede the class with the <em>@Database</em> annotation</li>
<li>Our database extends from <em>RoomDatabase</em></li>
<li>We have to provide an abstract method to <em>return the DAO</em>
    <ul>
    <li>The outside world, such as our Activity, will call this</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>We then begin our <em>companion object</em>
    <ul>
    <li>This contains our single instance of the <em>StudentDatabase</em>
    object (as we are using the singleton pattern)</li>
    <li>Using standard singleton logic, the <em>getDatabase()</em> method
    tests if the instance is null; if it is, we create the instance and
    return it, if it isn't, we simply return it.</li>
    <li>This will ensure that there will only ever be one instance of
    our StudentDatabase</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Note how we specify the database name (<em>studentDatabase</em>) when we
create our database object</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our main activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we need a main activity for our application</li>
<li>This needs to obtain the database (using the <em>getDatabase()</em> method
of the companion object of our database class</li>
<li>Once we have our database, we can obtain the DAO and call its methods</li>
<li>Note that <em>operations to query the database have to go in a 
separate, background coroutine</em> so that the user interface doesn't 
become unresponsive while waiting for the database transactions to take
place</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Coroutines and Context</h3>
<p>Last week we looked at coroutines. One thing we did not examine though was the concept of coroutine <em>context</em>. Each coroutine runs in a <em>context</em> which determines whether the coroutine runs in the
foreground or background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically, each context would run in a separate thread or group
of threads.</li>
<li>In Android, there are three available contexts:
    <ul>
    <li><em><code>Dispatchers.Main</code></em> - always runs in the foreground in
    Android; code which needs to interact with the GUI would go in here. This is the default context.</li>
    <li><em><code>Dispatchers.IO</code></em> - a background context optimised for 
    input/output operations, for example network communication.</li>
    <li><em><code>Dispatchers.Default</code></em> - a background context optimised for
    heavy calculations and processing which does not use input/output. Despite the name, in Android it is not the default context; <code>Dispatchers.Main</code> is.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>We can <em>switch between contexts</em> and in this way, run some of
our code on the main thread and some in the background. When we switch context, the original coroutine <em>suspends</em>, waiting for the code in the other context to complete.</li>
<li>To switch context we use <code>withContext()</code> and specify a lambda or  suspend function which runs in the new context (typically a background context such as <code>Dispatchers.IO</code>). While it is running, the original coroutine suspends until the code in the new context has completed.
<pre>lifecycleScope.launch {
    // Code runs in the Dispatchers.Main context
    
    withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Code runs in the Dispatchers.IO context
    }
    
    // Code here runs once the withContext() block completes
}</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main activity - basic example</h3>
<p>This is a basic and incomplete example showing how to set up the activity to load the database. It also shows how to query a Room database inside <code>withContext()</code>.
<pre>
// Other imports left out...

import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch
import kotlinx.coroutines.withContext

class MainActivity: ComponentActivity() {
    lateinit var db: StudentDatabase

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        db = StudentDatabase.getDatabase(application)

        setContent {
            Button(onClick = {
                // If in a ViewModel, use viewModelScope (see last week)
                lifecycleScope.launch {
                    withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
                        // Room code should go here    
                        // Create an example Student and add it to the database
                        val s = Student(name="Alex Smith", course="SE", mark=77)
                        db.studentDao().add(s)
                    }
                    // UI code should go outside the "withContext()" block
                }
            }
            }) {
                Text("Add Student")
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>    
</p>
<h2>Room with ViewModel and LiveData</h2>
<p>Room works particularly well with a <code>ViewModel</code> and <code>LiveData</code>.</p>
<h3>Updating a Room DAO to return LiveData</h3>
<p>It's easy to update a DAO to return LiveData.We simply update our DAO so that the search methods return LiveData of the appropriate type. So, in a student records app, we might change:

<pre>@Query("SELECT * FROM students")
fun getAllStudents(): List&lt;Student&gt;</pre>

to:

<pre>@Query("SELECT * FROM students")
fun getAllStudents(): LiveData&lt;List&lt;Student&gt;&gt;</pre>

This allows other parts of your code to observe changes in the database and auto-update as the database  updates.</p>
<h3>Using LiveData and a ViewModel with Room</h3>

<p>The other thing we can do is to use both <code>LiveData</code> and a <code>ViewModel</code> together with Room. To do this you would return <code>LiveData</code> from the DAO (as above) and <em>store a reference to it in your <code>ViewModel</code></em>. Then, you can observe the data in the <code>ViewModel</code> with an <code>Observer</code>, as before.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a <code>ViewModel</code> set up to store <code>LiveData</code> from a Room database containing student records:
<pre>package com.example.roomapp

import android.app.Application
import androidx.lifecycle.AndroidViewModel
import androidx.lifecycle.LiveData

// We need to pass in the Application object
class StudentViewModel(app: Application): AndroidViewModel(app)  {
    // Get a reference to the database, using the Application object
    var db = StudentDatabase.getDatabase(app)
    var students : LiveData&lt;List&lt;Student&gt;&gt;

    // When we initialise the ViewModel, get the LiveData from the DAO
    // The variable 'students' will always contain the latest LiveData.
    init {
        students = db.studentDao().getAllStudents()
    }

    // Return the LiveData, so it can be observed, e.g. from the MainActivity
    fun getAllStudents(): LiveData&lt;List&lt;Student&gt;&gt; {
        return students
    }

    fun addStudent(name: String, course: String) {
        // add a student by launching a coroutine as above, but using viewModelScope instead of lifecycleScope
    }
}</pre>
The <code>ViewModel</code> would then be setup from the <code>MainActivity</code> in the normal way:
<pre>
val viewModel : StudentViewModel by viewModels()
</pre>
and observed in the normal way by observing the <code>getAllStudents()</code> method of the <code>ViewModel</code>:
<pre>
viewModel.getAllStudents().observe(this) {
    stateResults = it // store data in 'stateResults', a SnapshotStateList state variable (i.e. initialised with mutableStateListOf() )
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>As shown by the <code>addStudent()</code> method in the <code>ViewModel</code> above, we could also add methods to the <code>ViewModel</code> to perform database operations by launching a coroutine in <code>viewModelScope</code>, rather than <code>lifecycleScope</code>. By doing so, our code would be protected against being terminated early if the device is rotated.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<h3>Setting up Room in Android Studio</h3>
<p>You need to add the Room dependencies to your project. This is a little more involved than normal as you have to include the Room Compiler, which processes the Room annotations and converts them into regular code. This involves a tool known as <em>KSP</em>.</p>
<h4>Setting up the version catalog</h4>
<p>First setup your version catalog (<code>libs.versions.toml</code>) as shown below. Note the highlighted sections: these are the Room dependencies.</p>
<img src="../images/room_versioncatalog.png" alt="Setting up version catalog for Room" />
<p>
These include the Room version, the KSP version (see below), the Room libraries needed, and the <em>KSP plugin</em> (see below) in the <code>[plugins]</code> section.
</p>
<h4>KSP</h4>
<p>Note the entry in the plugins section. What is this? <em>KSP</em> (Kotlin Symbol Processing) is a tool which will process Java-based annotations in Kotlin code, such as the annotations used by Room. See <a href='https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-ksp'>the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To set up KSP you need to add it to choose an appropriate version. 
Note the version in the example above <code>2.0.0-1.0.23</code>, this is specific to my system. The exact version you need to choose depends on the version of the Kotlin compiler on your system.  The first number is the Kotlin compiler version and the second number is the KSP version. You need to choose a version which corresponds to your Kotlin compiler version (2.0.0 in this example). To find out the Kotlin version, go to <em>File-Settings-Other Settings-Kotlin Compiler</em> in Android Studio.</p>
<p>Then lookup the KSP versions at <a href='https://github.com/google/ksp/releases'>the GitHub repository</a> and choose the most recent version which is compatible with your version of Kotlin.
</p>
<h4>Setting up the build.gradle.kts</h4>
<p>Having added Room and KSP to your version catalog, you need to then specify the dependencies in your app <code>build.gradle.kts</code>. There are two things you need to do, specify the regular libraries and then specify the KSP plugin. First, the regular libraries:</p>
<img src="../images/room_dependencies.png" alt="Specifying Room dependencies" />
<p>Then you need to specify the KSP plugin, within the <code>plugins</code> section of your <code>build.gradle.kts</code> (at the top):</p>
<img src="../images/room_plugins.png" alt="Specifying Room KSP plugin" />

<h3>Important - Using KAPT if KSP does not work</h3>
<p>For a currently-unknown reason, KSP was (one year ago - the issue has possibly been fixed) not compatible with some configurations of Android Studio. If you obtain obscure errors when using KSP (ensuring you follow the instructions carefully), please use the older <em>KAPT</em> tool instead. To use KAPT instead of KSP:
<ul>
<li>Do not add the KSP line to the <code>plugins</code> in the <code>build.gradle.kts</code>;</li>
<li>Replace the KSP line in the <code>plugins</code> in the App <code>build.gradle.kts</code> with:
<pre>id("kotlin-kapt")</pre>
as shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/kapt1.png" alt="Including the KAPT plugin" />
<br />
</li>
<li>Change the Java version in <code>compileOptions</code> and <code>kotlinOptions</code> from 1.8 to 17 in the app <code>build.gradle.kts</code>, as shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/kapt2.png" alt="Changing the Java version" />
<br />
</li>
<li>When including the Room compiler in your dependencies, use <code>kapt</code> instead of <code>ksp</code> (note, this screenshot was from an older version of Android Studio which added dependencies directly in the <code>build.gradle.kts</code> rather than the version catalog):
<br />
<img src="../images/kapt3.png" alt="Using kapt to include the Kotlin compiler" />
<br />
</li>
<li>If you get an error stating that API 34 is needed, please <em>downgrade</em> the Room version from 2.6.1 to 2.2.3. Replace 2.6.1 with 2.2.3 in all three dependencies above.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Viewing the database from Android Studio</h3>
<p>You can view your database from Android Studio by selecting <em>View-Tool Windows-App Inspection</em>. You have to use a device running at least API 26 to do this. Here is an example:
<br />
<img src="../images/app_inspection.png" alt="Using App Inspection to view the database" />
</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Develop an application to store music in an SQLite database using Room.
Use <strong>a device running at least API level 26</strong> so you can use the Database Inspector to visualise your database.</p>
<p>The Activity should have a layout with four fields: ID, Title, Artist and Year, with four buttons (Search by ID, Add, Update, Delete). These buttons should
have the following effects. Each should call an appropriate method in your
DAO. These buttons should perform the following operations:
<ul>
<li>Add - add the Title, Artist and Year in the appropriate fields to a "hits" table in an SQLite database. <strong>The ID field should be ignored, as the database will allocate an ID</strong>. Once added, however, the ID field should be filled in with the allocated ID. (Note that DAO insert methods will return the new ID as a Long as long as it's declared in the method signature - see the example)</li>
<li>Search by ID - find the record with the ID the user entered in the ID field. Display the details of the found song in the other three fields (title, artist, year). An error (a toast is fine) should appear if that song does not exist. Note that you might find Kotlin's <code>also()</code> method useful here:
<pre>
foundSong?.apply {
    // process the song if it was found
}.also {
    if(it == null) {
        // handle no song found
    }
}
</pre>
The use of <code>also()</code> allows you to do further processing on a given object after we've performed one action (handling the found song if it exists, in this example). It allows you to <em>chain</em> a series of lambda functions to be performed on an object.
</li>
<li>Update - should update the details of the song with the ID entered in the ID field to the title, artist and year entered in the appropriate fields.
Again display an error if the song with that ID does not
exist.</li>
<li>Delete - delete the song with the ID the user entered. Again, display an error if the song with that ID does not exist.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hint:</strong> store the current song in a state variable.</p>
<h3>More advanced question</h3>
<p>Rewrite your code to use a <code>ViewModel</code> and <code>LiveData</code>, making a list of all songs in the database available as <code>LiveData</code>. Run the "add song" database operation from a coroutine launched in <code>viewModelScope</code>, within a method of your <code>ViewModel</code>. Also, observe the <code>LiveData</code> from your composable hierarchy and display a list of all songs added so far, using a <code>LazyColumn</code>.</p>
