<h1>Mobile Application Development - Part 10</h1>
<h1>Introduction to Fragments</h1>
</div>

<h2>Introduction - the need for fragments</h2>

<p>Originally, Android ran primarily on phones, and the model of a main activity for the main screen, followed by sub-activities
for lists, preferences, and so on, worked well. However, after a while, Android tablets with larger screens started appearing. For tablets, having
to navigate to a separate activity to choose one of a list of options, or to set preferences, is a little wasteful in terms of time: would it not be better for a tablet if the main activity and sub-activities shared screen space?
For example, in an app which shows local restaurants, you could have a map on the main part of the screen and a sidebar containing a list
allowing the user to select restaurant types (Chinese, Indian, etc). By contrast, on a phone the same app could have just the map on the 
main screen and the list of restaurant types as a separate activity.</p>

<p>So the question is, how can we do this? How can we develop an app in which two activities are on the main screen on a tablet, but on separate
screens on a phone? The first thing to realise is that <em>we can never have more than one activity per screen</em>, so we cannot simply
have two activities side by side. 
Instead, we do this through the use of <em>fragments</em>. A <em>fragment</em> is a sub-section of an activity which performs a 
specific job. So on the tablet, our main activity would contain two fragments (map and list) while on the phone, we would have two separate
activities, each with <em>one</em> fragment (either the map or the list).</p>

<p>This is illustrated in the diagrams below.</p>

<h3>Phone layout</h3>
<p><img src="../images/phonelayout.png" alt="Phone layout - two separate activities, each with own fragment" /></p>

<h3>Tablet layout</h3>
<p><img src="../images/tabletlayout.png" alt="Tablet layout - one activity with two side-by-side fragments" /></p>

<h3>Landscape vs. portrait</h3>

<p>The use of fragments is not restricted to tablets. Even if we are only interested in phones, in landscape mode
we might be able to fit two side-by-side fragments into the activity, while in portrait mode we would have to use two activities each with their own fragment.
Because you may not have access to a tablet, the examples will involve using a one-activity two-fragment layout in landscape mode and a
two-activity one-fragment-per-each layout in portrait mode. However the principles apply equally to phone vs. tablet.</p>

<h3>Dynamically swapping sections of the user interface</h3>
<p>Another common use of fragments is to <em>dynamically swap areas of screen content</em>. For example, in a music database application, the main activity could by default contain a fragment to allow the user to search for music. When the user selects a menu option, this fragment could be dynamically swapped for another fragment to allow the user to <em>add</em> a new song.</p>

<h2>Developing fragment-based apps</h2>

<p>We will do some work on fragments this week, and more next week. Today,
we will focus on <em>dynamically swapping sections of the user interface</em> and next week we will look at how we can send information between fragments.</p>

<h3>Navigation Drawer</h3>
<p>Before we look at fragments we will take a look at the <em>navigation drawer</em>. The navigation drawer is part of <em>material design</em>: a series of user interface guidelines for Android and web apps drawn up by Google. Material design comes with a series of standard components, of which the navigation drawer is one. The navigation drawer is a component allowing a "slide-out" menu from typically the left of the screen. A common pattern in fragment-based applications is to have menu options on a navigation drawer which swap one fragment for another.</p>

<h4>How to create a navigation drawer</h4>
<ul>
<li>
To create a navigation drawer, you need to use a DrawerLayout for your top-level layout</li>
<li>,To this, you add a layout element for your main UI and also a NavigationView object
</li>
<li>The NavigationView represents your navigation drawer.</li>
<li>For example:
<pre>
&lt;androidx.drawerlayout.widget.DrawerLayout android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/drawerLayout"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt;

    &lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

   
    ... MAIN ACTIVITY LAYOUT GOES HERE ...

    &lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;

    &lt;com.google.android.material.navigation.NavigationView
        android:id="@+id/nv"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_gravity="start"
        app:menu="@menu/menu" /&gt;

&lt;/androidx.drawerlayout.widget.DrawerLayout&gt;</pre>
</li>


<li>The layout_gravity specifies that the drawer will appear on the left hand side (or right for languages that read from right to left)</li>
<li>Note how we link the NavigationView to a menu with the app:menu property. Here we are specifying that the NavigationView will use the menu.xml file. The menu can either be the
same as the toolbar or an entirely different menu.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Handling a NavigationView selection</h4>
<ul>
<li>To handle the user selecting items in the navigation view, you have to use different code to regular menu handling with onOptionsItemSelected().</li>
<li>You have to set up a <em>NavigationItemSelectedListener</em> and override
<em>onNavigationItemSelected()</em>, though due to SAM conversions you can use a lambda:
<pre> 
nv.setNavigationItemSelectedListener {
    val returnValue = true
    when(it.itemId) {
        R.id.item1 -&gt; { 
            ... 
        }
        R.id.item2 -&gt; {
            ...
        }
        else -&gt;  { 
            returnValue = false    
        }
    }
    returnValue // can omit "return" in lambdas
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>NavigationDrawer and Fragments</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A common approach is to combine the NavigationDrawer with fragments, so that the user can navigate between different subsections of the app without having to move to a new Activity. Each subscreen has its own Fragment and when the user selects a particular item in the Navigation Drawer, the fragment showing in the main activity is replaced by another.
</li>
<li>To do this, you need to make the main area of your layout a 
    <em>FrameLayout</em>.</li>
<li> A FrameLayout is a layout designed for holding other components, such as fragments. An example of such a layout is below, note the FrameLayout within the constraint layout:

<pre>androidx.drawerlayout.widget.DrawerLayout android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/drawerLayout"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt;

    &lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

    &lt;FrameLayout
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        android:id="@+id/frameLayout1"/&gt;

    &lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;

    &lt;com.google.android.material.navigation.NavigationView
        android:id="@+id/nv"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_gravity="start"
        app:menu="@menu/menu" /&gt;

&lt;/androidx.drawerlayout.widget.DrawerLayout&gt;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each entry in the Navigation Drawer should make a particular
fragment appear in the FrameLayout when selected. To do this we will make use
of <em>fragment transactions</em>, described below. Before we do this, we
will discuss how to code a simple Fragment. The Fragment would be in a separate
class, entirely separate to the main activity.</p>
<h3>Coding a fragment</h3> 
<p>Here is a simple example of code for a Fragment; note how we call the superclass constructor (<code>Fragment(R.layout.frag1)</code>) passing in a layout ID (<code>R.layout.frag1</code>, referencing <code>frag1.xml</code>). This specifies the layout of the fragment.
<pre>
import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment

class Frag1 : Fragment(R.layout.frag1) {

}</pre>
</p>
<h3>Fragment transactions</h3>
<p>We will now return to replacing the fragment inside the FrameLayout with
another. We use a <em>fragment transaction</em> for this. To perform fragment transactions, we need to use a <em>fragment manager</em>, which is a general class for managing fragments (for example adding a fragment to an activity's UI, or replacing a fragment with another). The code below shows how you can replace the contents of the FrameLayout using a fragment transaction. Imagine we have two fragment classes, <code>Frag1</code> and <code>Frag2</code>, and we want to swap between these two fragments when the user selects the appropriate menu items in the navigation drawer:
<pre>val frag1 = Frag1() // create instance of fragment 1
val frag2 = Frag2() // create instance of fragment 2
nv.setNavigationItemSelectedListener {
    val frag = if (it.itemId == R.id.item1) frag1 else frag2 
    drawerLayout.closeDrawers()
    supportFragmentManager.commit {
        replace(R.id.frameLayout1, frag)
    }
    true
}</pre>
</li>
<li>Note how we create instances of both fragment classes, <code>Frag1</code> and <code>Frag2</code>, and use the fragment manager to replace the contents of the frame layout with the selected fragment.</li>
<li>Also note how we close the drawer with <em>drawerLayout.closeDrawers()</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Full navigation drawer layout example with fragment transactions</h3>
<p>Note from this example that, when the activity <em>first runs</em>, 
we need to perform a fragment transaction to fill the initial empty FrameLayout with whichever fragment you want to appear by default.
<pre>package com.example.navdrawerapp

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        val nv = findViewById&lt;NavigationView&gt;(R.id.nv)
        val drawerLayout = findViewById&lt;DrawerLayout&gt;(R.id.drawerLayout)

        val frag1 = Frag1()
        val frag2 = Frag2()

        nv.setNavigationItemSelectedListener {
            val frag = if (it.itemId == R.id.item1) frag1 else frag2 
            drawerLayout.closeDrawers()
            supportFragmentManager.commit {
                replace(R.id.frameLayout1, frag)
            }
            true
        }
        // Fill the FrameLayout with fragment 1 by default
        supportFragmentManager.commit {
            replace(R.id.frameLayout1, frag1)
        }
    }
}</pre>
</p>
<h3>Which dependencies should be included?</h3>
<p>To work with the above example you need to include the following dependencies, which include the Material Design components and fragments respectively:
<pre>implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.3.0'
implementation 'androidx.fragment:fragment-ktx:1.3.5'</pre>
</p>
<h3>Accessing elements within the fragment layout</h3>
<p>To access elements of a fragment layout, you need to use <code>findViewById()</code> on the fragment's <code>view</code> property; this is because the elements are part of the <em>fragment</em>'s layout, not part of the layout of the activity. </p>
<p>The code to setup event handling the elements of the fragment's layout should go <strong>inside the onViewCreated() method of your fragment.</strong> Only in <code>onViewCreated()</code> will the View object contained within the fragment be fully initialised. Before this the fragment's view may be null which means you cannot access the UI elements. <code>onViewCreated()</code> takes the fragment's View as an argument, so you can use this to access the View inside this method.</p>
<p>Here is an example, which sets up an event handler for the button in <code>onViewCreated()</code>: 
<pre>// Your fragment
class Frag1 : Fragment(R.layout.frag1) {
    override fun onViewCreated(fragmentView: View, b: Bundle?) {
        val btn1 = fragmentView.findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.btn1)
        btn1.setOnClickListener {
            val et1 = fragmentView.findViewById&lt;EditText&gt;(R.id.et1)
            // ... do something with the contents of the edit text
        }
    }
}</pre>
</p>
<h3>Accessing the activity within the fragment</h3>
<p>A fragment may use functionality that needs an activity passed in as an argument, e.g. it may need to create an AlertDialog or a Toast, or interact with a database. This is easily obtained: inside the fragment you can use <code>activity</code> to refer to the parent activity.</p>
<h3>Saving the state of the fragment - a hint for the assignment</h3>
<p>When a fragment transaction replaces a fragment, its XML layout will be read again and <em>inflated</em> into memory as a hierarchy of View objects. This can cause a problem in some circumstances, such as a mapping application, in which you want to save the map's state as you navigate between fragments. Imagine you implement a fragment-based mapping activity in which you have a map fragment, and a fragment to allow the user to change the map's position (via latitude and longitude <code>EditText</code>s). To navigate from the map fragment to the set-position fragment, a fragment transaction will take place. And when the user then returns to the map fragment, another fragment transaction will take place to replace the set-posiiton fragment with the map fragment again. At this point, <strong>the <code>MapView</code> object will be reset and re-initialised</strong> as it is re-inflated from the XML. So, for example, if at some previous point the user changed the map style to the OpenTopoMap style, this change will be forgotten as the map is re-initialised as if from scratch. So you need to implement some logic to <em>save the state of the map</em> when the fragment is replaced, and <em>restore it</em> when the fragment becomes visible again. The former (saving the map's state) can be done in the fragment's <code>onDestroy()</code> method, e.g:
<pre>
override fun onDestroy() {
    // isOpenTopo is a boolean, which is true if the current tile source of 
    // the map is OpenTopoMap.
    isOpenTopo = map1?.tileProvider?.tileSource == TileSourceFactory.OpenTopo
    super.onDestroy()
}
</pre>
and the latter would be done in <code>onViewCreated()</code>:
<pre>
override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    val map = view.findViewById(R.id.map1)
    map?.apply {
        this.tileProvider.tileSource = if(isOpenTopo) TileSourceFactory.OpenTopo else TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK
    }
}
</pre>
Note how we find the map using its ID and then set its tile source (i.e. style) to the style that was saved when the fragment was previously destroyed.
</p>
<h4>Setting properties before replacing the fragment</h4>
<p>What do we do if we want to update the properties of fragment before we
make it appear via a transaction? For example, a user might enter a latitude and longitude in one fragment, which is used to update the map in another fragment.
You might think that you could:
    <ul>
    <li>Replace the 'set location' fragment with the map fragment, and then</li>
    <li>Set the map position on the map fragment to the latitude and longitude
    entered by the user on the 'set location' fragment.</li>
    </ul>
However, the issue here is that the fragment transaction process is 
<em>asynchronous</em> and might take some time to complete. So the second
step, updating the map position to the latitude and longitude entered by the
user, might complete <em>before</em> the fragment transaction is complete,
as the transaction is running simulatenously. Remember we said above that
the map is <em>reset</em> by inflating the XML layout in the fragment
transaction. So the likely result is that the map position would be updated
to the new position, but then, as the fragment transaction completes afterwards, reset to the default position!</p>
<p>One way of dealing with this is to set <em>pending properties</em> on
the fragment before performing the transaction. Then, after inflating the
layout, i.e. in <code>onViewCreated()</code>, we can set the map's properties
to the pending properties if they exist. For example, in the fragment:
<pre>
fun setPendingLocation(pendingLat: Double, pendingLon: Double) {
    this.pendingLon = pendingLon
    this.pendingLat = pendingLat
    this.pendingLocationUpdate = true // indicates there's a pending location update
}
</pre>
and in <code>onViewCreated()</code>:
<pre>
override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    val map = view.findViewById(R.id.map1)
    map?.apply {
        this.tileProvider.tileSource = if(isOpenTopo) TileSourceFactory.OpenTopo else TileSourceFactory.MAPNIK
        if(pendingLocationUpdate) {
            this.controller.setCenter(GeoPoint(pendingLat, pendingLon))
            pendingLocationUpdate = false // no pending update now
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Return to your Room database application (week 7) and modify to use fragments. Change your activity to use a DrawerLayout and a navigation drawer. There
should be two fragments, of which only one should be visible at a time. Each
fragment will need its own XML layout (separate from the main activity layout). So you will need:
<ul>
<li>a main activity;</li>
<li>the main activity XML layout, with DrawerLayout and navigation drawer;</li>
<li>two fragment classes;</li>
<li>two fragment XML layouts, one for each fragment.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Do the following:
<ul>
<li>One fragment should allow allow the user to search. The user should be able to search by artist (use an EditText in the fragment's layout), and when a button is pressed, all the search results should appear in a TextView below the EditText. This fragment should appear when the activity is first created.</li>
<li> the second fragment should allow the user to enter a new song. The fragment's layout should be fields for song, artist and year and when a button is pressed, the song should be added to the database.</li>
</ul>
Use menu items in the navigation drawer to select which fragment will appear.</p>
<p>If you get that done, have a go at converting your networked application from the last two weeks (either the standard version or the RecyclerView version) to use fragments - again one for search, and one for adding a song.</p>
