<h2>Further introductory Jetpack Compose topics</h2>
<h3>Units of Measurement</h3>
<p>During the lab session last week we looked at how to specify font size, e.g.:
<pre>Text("Hello World!", fontSize=24.sp)</pre>
What does the font size <code>24.sp</code> mean? It's not just a number but a number with <code>.sp</code> appended. This is another example of an <em>extension function</em> on <code>Int</code>, as we saw last time, but what does <code>.sp</code> mean?</p>

<p>Before discussing <code>sp</code>, we will discuss the similar <code>dp</code> unit. What is the <code>dp</code> unit? 
<ul>
<li>A <code>dp</code> is a <em>density-independent pixel</em>: a virtual pixel, corresponding to varying numbers of real pixels, which ensures that page elements occupy the same dimensions on the screen across different devices.</li>
<li>Why do we need to do this? Different devices have different <em>pixel density</em>, in other words they contain varying numbers of pixels within a given distance on the screen, such as one centimetre or one inch (approximately 2.5cm). High-density screens have many pixels within a given distance, while low-density screens have less. Thus, density-independent pixels account for different pixel density of screens to ensure consistent appearance across different devices). If we used regular pixels for the width or height, UI elements would occupy different proportions of the screen on different devices. This is shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/dp.png" alt="Density-independent pixels" />
<br />
</li>
<li>Density-independent pixels correspond exactly to pixels at a pixel density of 160 pixels per inch. If the density is greater than that, one density-independent pixel will occupy more than one real pixel, while if it is less, one dp will occupy less than one real pixel. See <a href='https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities'>the Android documentation</a> for more information on density-independent pixels, as well as this <a href='https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/layout-and-content/grids-and-units'>documentation on units of distance in Android in general</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>What then are <code>sp</code>? These are <em>scalable pixels</em>, which are basically the same as density-independent pixels, but they adapt to the user's chosen font size as well as the pixel density and thus should be used for specifying font size.</p>

<h3>Modifiers</h3>
<p>We can modify the appearance of UI elements with <em>modifiers</em> which allow you to control such things as padding, borders, etc. Modifiers are optional in some cases but compulsory in others. Modifiers are compulsory in the case of the <code>Spacer</code>, which is an element used to provide space between other elements. Here is the previous example with a <code>Spacer</code>:
<pre>package com.example.jetpackcompose3 

import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity
import androidx.activity.compose.setContent
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.compose.material3.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column
import androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontFamily
import androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontStyle
import androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontWeight
import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.sp
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Spacer
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.height

class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        setContent {
            TwoTexts()
        }
    }

    @Composable
    fun TwoTexts() {
        Column {
            Text("Hello World!", color = Color.red, fontStyle=FontStyle.Italic, fontSize=24.sp, fontFamily=FontFamily.Serif)
            Spacer(Modifier.height(32.dp))
            Text("Welcome to Android Development", fontWeight=FontWeight.Bold, fontSize=18.sp)
        }
    }
}</pre>
This creates a spacer with a height of 32 density independent pixels (see above).</p>

<p>Other modifiers allow us to specify <em>padding</em> (the space between the border of a UI element and its content) or an element's <em>border</em>. For example, this surrounds a <code>GreetingComponent</code> component with a 2 dp wide blue border and with <em>padding</em> of 16dp between the border and the content. Note how <code>Modifier</code> contains many methods to modify different aspects of the element, and note how they can all be chained together.
<pre>
Greeting(
    Modifier.border(BorderStroke(2.dp, Color.Blue))
            .padding(16.dp)
)
</pre>
Our <code>GreetingComponent</code> would now need to take a modifier as a parameter. This would then be passed onto the <code>Column</code> which sets the layout within the greeting component. 
<pre>
@Composable
fun GreetingComponent(<em>mod: Modifier</em>) {
    var name by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    Column(<em>mod</em>) {
        ...
    }
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Material Design</h2>

<p><em>Material Design</em> (see <a href='https://material.io'>the website</a>) is a published design philosophy which is adopted as the recommended standard in Android development. It revolves around the idea of screen surfaces being composed of <em>material</em> which has certain visual and behavioural properties, for example the ability to cast shadows when raised, and only UI elements at the top of a stack of elements being able to receive events. Material Design specifies a range of standard UI components, such as buttons, text fields and many others. Following the Material Design philosophy allows the development of clean-looking, usable and intuitive apps.</p>


<p>Material Design has a range of key aspects, with three particularly important components including:
<ul>
<li><em>Colour</em>. A Material Design UI consists of a series of pre-defined colours, each used for specific roles. For example one colour will be used for UI elements such as buttons, another for text, another for the navigation bar, and so on.  More detail at <href='https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles'>material.io</a>.
</li>


<li><em>Typography</em>. Material Design specifies a range of standard types of text, such as headings and body text. With each text type you specify a pre-defined font. So you specify one font to be used for all headings, another to be used for all body text, and so on.</li>

<li><em>Shape</em>. Material Design provides a range of <em>shapes</em> for components. These describe the extent of rounded corners, which can range from None (rectangular) to full (fully-rounded corners). Shapes are described <a href='https://m3.material.io/styles/shape/overview'>here</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>Through colour, typography and shape, Material Design  helps you design appealing and consistent UIs. How can it do this?
</p>
<p>When designing a UI, you need to think about <strong>classifying your UI elements</strong> in terms of which should be particularly prominent to the user and which can be less prominent because they are less critical to the functionality of the app. This helps you break down the UI into different <em>classes</em> of component. The idea is that you style components of the same importance class similarly.</p>
<p>So for example prominent UI controls such as buttons should all have the same style (same colour and/or typography). Rather than using a random mix of styles in your app, with multiple different colours and fonts, you define colours and fonts for each class of UI element and apply them appropriately. So for colour for example, you create a palette of colours for your app and apply colours from this palette appropriately for different classes of UI element.</p>
<p>So in summary, by setting the properties of these colour, typography and shape classes you can ensure a consistent look and feel across similar elements, enhancing usability and aesthetics of the app.
</p>

<h3>More detail on colour roles</h3>
<p>Material Design features a number of so-called <em>colour roles</em>. These are described <a href='https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles'>here</a>. Colour roles include, amongst others:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Primary</em> : used for particularly prominent components such as particularly prominent buttons.</li>
    <li><em>Secondary</em> : used for less prominent components.</li>
    <li><em>Tertiary</em> : used for components which you want to highlight, to stand out from the general UI.</li>
    <li><em>On-primary, on-secondary, and on-tertiary</em>. Used for content displayed on top of primary, secondary, and tertiary colours respectively, such as text.</li>
    <li><em>Surface</em> - used for background colour on a <code>Surface</code>. We will discuss <code>Surface</code> below.</li>
    <li><em>Container colours</em> - primary container, secondary container, etc. Designed for the fill colour for particularly prominent foreground elements which contain content of some kind. Container colours also have equivalent <em>on</em> colours e.g. <em>On-primary container</em> for text on a primary container.</li>
    </ul>
So to design the colour scheme for a Material Design app, you should pick appropriate colours for these colour roles, and ensure you pick the correct colour role for a given component.</p>

<h3>More detail on typography</h3>

<p>Just as for colour roles, Material Design offers a range of typography classifications. See <a href='https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview'>here</a> and <a href='https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/applying-type'>here</a> for more detail. The descriptions below are paraphrased from the second of these two articles.
    <ul>
    <li><em>Headline</em> - for emphasising particularly important sections of text (just like a news headline).
    <li><em>Title</em> - for titles (e.g. of a section of a document) or text of similar importance.</li>
    <li><em>Body</em> - used for paragraphs of text.</li>
    <li><em>Label</em> - used for text purely for labelling items, such as components. A good example, quoted in the article linked to above, is text on a button.</li>
    </ul>
Within each category, you can specify large, medium or small variants. The concept is again like colour. By defining certain fonts for each typography type, you are ensuring a consistent appearance across UI elements of the same type or class.</p>

<h2>Using Material Design in Jetpack Compose</h2>
<p>Having considered some of the absolute basics of Material Design, we will now see how we can use Material Design in a Jetpack Compose app.</p>
<h3>Setting up Material Design in Jetpack Compose</h3>

<p>Jetpack Compose integrates very well with Material Design and in fact supports the latest Material Design standard, version 3. Jetpack Compose allows you to define a <em>theme</em>, which is a collection of colours and typographies which will be applied to your Compose app. Android Studio pre-generates logic to create your theme for you.</p>

<p>Below shows the location of the pre-generated theme files for your project. They are within the <code>ui.theme</code> subpackage:
<br />
<img src="../images/compose-theme.png" alt="Compose theme source files" />
</p>

<p>You can edit the theme files to set the theme for your app, in other words you can customise the different colour types (primary, secondary, tertiary, on-primary, etc) and typography. <code>Color.kt</code> contains colour definitions, <code>Type.kt</code> contains typography definitions and <code>Theme.kt</code> manages the theme as a whole.</p> 

<h3>Using a Theme</h3>
<p>The <code>Theme.kt</code> file in the theme package provides a function you can use to apply your theme to your UI. This will be named <code>&lt;project name&gt;</code> plus the string <code>Theme</code>. For example if your project is called <code>ComposeExample2</code>, the theme function will be <code>ComposeExample2Theme</code>. Because this function takes a composable function (usually a lambda) as its argument, you can simply add composables inside it and apply it as follows:
<pre>
setContent {
    ComposeExample2Theme {
        Text("Some text")
        TextField(...)
    }
}
</pre>
All composables inside the theme will have the theme applied to them.</p>

<h4>Setting theme colours and fonts</h4>

<p>Material Design components will use default settings appropriate to that component. You can also, however. access the theme's colour and typography via the <code>MaterialTheme</code> class. This has a <code>colorScheme</code> property to access the colour roles, and a <code>typography</code> property to access the various font styles. For example:
    <ul>
    <li><code>MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary</code> for the primary colour;</li>
    <li><code>MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onSecondary</code> for the on-secondary colour;</li>
    <li><code>MaterialTheme.typography.titleLarge</code> for the Large Title font;</li>
    <li><code>MaterialTheme.typography.bodySmall</code> for the Small Body text font.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Using a Surface</h3>

<p>The most fundamental UI component of Material Design is the <em>surface</em>. The <code>Surface</code> is the UI element which your Material Design theme is applied to, so you should wrap all your other components in a Surface. Surfaces can be styled, for example you can set the shape to specify the extent of curvature at the corners. You can have a surface on top of another surface, and each surface can be styled differently.</p>

<p>To use a Surface, simply wrap it round the other UI elements, e.g.
<pre>
import androidx.compose.material3.Surface
import your.package.ComposeExample2Theme // replace "your.package" and the project name!

setContent {
    ComposeExample2Theme {
        Surface(modifier=Modifier.fillMaxSize(),shape=MaterialTheme.Shapes.large, shadowElevation=1.dp) {
            Text("Some text")
            TextField(...)
       }
    }
}
</pre>
This example shows:
    <ul>
    <li>a modifier which causes the <code>Surface</code> to occupy the whole of its parent, in other words the <code>Activity</code>;</li>
    <li>a <code>shape</code> parameter of <code>MaterialTheme.shapes.large</code>, in other words it will have large rounded corners;</li>
    <li>a <em>shadow elevation</em> of 1dp. This sets the elevation of the surface above screen level, which enables it to cast a shadow, producing a more "life like" experience (in real life, a piece of paper on a table would be slightly elevated from it and would thus cast a slight shadow).</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>Will appear here.</p>
<h2>Implementing Lists of Data - A Discussion Exercise</h2>

<p>You may be able to figure out how to create a <em>list</em> of data. We will discuss this <em>as an exercise in class</em>. <strong>Think about how you would create a Compose application which implements a shopping list.</strong> It should contain a <code>TextField</code> allowing the user to enter an item, a <code>Button</code> which when pressed adds the item to the list, and then, below that, the shopping list itself should be displayed, with each item on a separate line. There should also be a "Clear" button which clears the list.</p>

<p>After we have done this discussion exercise, we will start implementing it. You may encounter one or two problems along the way, but we will discuss these. After the class, notes will appear on how to do this, but they are not there just yet!</p>

<h3>Lazy Lists</h3>

<p>One issue with a long list of items is that by default, a long list consisting of a series of <code>Text</code> items in a <code>Column</code> will not be memory efficient. Why? Let's say there are 100 items in the list, but only 10 are visible on the screen at any time. The items off the screen are still being rendered, even though they are invisible. This is clearly inefficient.</p>

<p>We can solve this problem through the use of <em>lazy columns</em>. The <code>LazyColumn</code> is designed to hold a series of items (i.e. a list) but is implemented with memory optimisation so that only for the items currently visible are rendered.</p>

<p>Creating a <code>LazyColumn</code> is quite straightforward, you place it in the appropriate place in your layout and then specify a lambda to control how it works. This lambda takes an object of type <code>LazyListScope</code> as its single parameter and this object includes an <code>items</code> method to specify a list of items. For example:
<pre>
import androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn
import androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.items

LazyColumn {
    items(listItems) { curItem -&gt; Text(curItem) }
}
</pre>
Note how <code>items()</code> takes the list of items to render as its first parameter and another lambda as its last parameter. This lambda specifies how each item in the list of data should be transformed into a Compose element. So here, each item in the list is transformed to a <code>Text</code> element containing its details.</p>

<p>Messaging app, with simulated two users?</p>
<p>Switch or checkbox?</p>
<p>Left and right justification?</p>
-->

<h2>Advanced exercise</h2>
<p>Will appear here.</p>
<!--
<p>Have a go at implementing a prototype of a simple messaging application using Jetpack Compose (which lacks the communication-between-two-users aspect!). It should:
<ul>
<li>contain a <code>TextField</code> allowing the user to enter a message;</li>
<li>contain a button which adds the message to a list of messages;</li>
<li>messages should alternate between being displayed on the left and the right of the screen, and alternate between being coloured with <code>MaterialTheme.colorScheme.secondary</code> and <code>MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary</code>.
</li>
<li>Try and figure out how to lay this out realistically. Some hints:
	<ul>
	<li>Use a <code>Row</code> to contain each message.</li>
	<li><code>Row</code> takes, as a named parameter, <code>horizontalArrangement</code> which can be set to <code>Arrangement.End</code> (items are added to the end of the row) or <code>Arrangement.Start</code> (items are added to the start). Set it appropriately for each message.</li>
	<li>The <code>Row</code> should contain a separate <code>Surface</code> to contain the message. The idea of a separate <code>Surface</code> is that it can e styled separately to the main <code>Surface</code>. Set its colour as described above.</li>
	<li>To prevent messages occupying the whole width of the screen, give each message a <em>padding</em>. Messages on the left should have the <em>end padding</em> (padding on the right) set to 30dp, and messages on the right should have the <em>start padding</em> (padding on the left) set to 30dp. You can set individual paddings by passing named parameters to <code>Modifier.padding</code>, e.g:
<pre>Modifier.padding(start = ..., end = ...)</pre></li>
	<li>The <code>Surface</code> should contain a <code>Text</code> with the appropriate message. What colour should the text be set to?</li>
	<li>Can you also use padding on the <code>Text</code>?</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
