<h2 id='thisAndCallbacks'>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are a number of subtleties with JavaScript <em>this</em> which you need to understand to work
effectively with objects, and which make its use
less straightforward than the use of <em>this</em> in other languages such as Java and C++. <strong>These subtleties are particularly important when it
comes to callbacks.</strong></p>
<h3>"this" and the window object</h3>
<p>Firstly, what does <em>this</em> refer to if it is not being used in the context of an object?
For example, if the function below was run, what would be displayed?
<pre>
function thisTest()
{
    alert(this);
}
</pre>
On Firefox it displays:
<pre>[object Window]</pre>
The output demonstrates what <em>this</em> refers to when out of the context of an object. It refers to a <em>"default object"</em> which in a web browser is the <em>window</em> object, representing
the browser window as a whole. So the example below would work too:
<pre>
function thisTest()
{
    window.alert("alert is actually a method of the window object!");
    this.alert("... and here, *this* refers to the window so this works too!");
}
</pre>
Both alerts are displayed. <em>alert()</em> is actually a method of the window object, but because
the window object is the environment's "default" object, we can normally leave <em>window</em> out;
it's included here just to illustrate the point. And
because <em>this</em> also refers to the window object in this context, the second alert will be
displayed too.</p>
<h3>"this" and callbacks - the problem</h3>
<p>The problem most commonly encountered with "this" is 
when it is being used in a <em>callback function</em>. As we have
seen, a <em>callback function</em> is a function that does not run immediately,
but at a later time, when some event has occurred (such as the user clicking a button,
or the response from an AJAX request is received). So imagine we had a Cat and we wanted it to meow if
we pressed a button, e.g:
<pre>
// cat.js
class Cat 
{

    constructor(n,a)
    {
        this.theName=n;
        this.age=a;
    }

    meow()
    {
        alert(`${this.theName} says meow!`);
    }
}



// Create the cat
const tom = new Cat("Tom", 7);

// When the user clicks the button, the meow method will run
document.getElementById("meowbtn").addEventListener("click", tom.meow);

</pre>
HTML:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='cat.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;input type='button' id='meowbtn' value='Meow!' /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>If you try this out, and click the button, does the expected output:
<pre>Tom says Meow!</pre>
occur? No. Instead, you will get something like:
<pre>undefined says Meow!</pre>
Why is this happening? 
<ul>
<li>On a simple level, it is because <em>callback functions do not keep track of the object that
the method relates to.</em> So when we click the button, the meow function will be called but
the fact that it relates to the object <em>tom</em> is not retained. So when we try to display
<em>theName</em> of the current object, we get <em>undefined</em> because the current object
is not <em>tom</em> and hence has no <em>theName</em> property</li>
<li>To explain in more depth: <em>when we are using a callback function, the context of
the function changes</em>. In this example, we are basically setting the <em>click</em>
event handler of the button to be the meow method of the object <em>tom</em>. But the object
<em>tom</em> itself is <em>not</em> copied across. Instead, the code in <em>meow()</em> is copied
across to the button object, and becomes the <em>click</em> method of the button object. So,
when we click the button, <em>this</em> is actually the button object! Buttons do not have a
<em>theName</em> property, so we get <em>undefined</em>.</li>
<li>Note that <em>arrow functions always preserve the context of this</em>
so we don't have the same sort of problem if we use an arrow function as a 
callback. However, frequently we want to make a method of a class or object a callback function, as 
we have done here. In these cases, we are forced to deal with the
the "context of this" problem and ensure that <em>this</em> refers to
the correct object in the callback.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Dealing with "this" issues in callbacks with bind()</h3>
<p>Luckily, the issue is easy to deal with.
You can simply use the <em>bind()</em> method.
<em>bind()</em> does what it says on the tin: it binds the callback function to the specified
object, so that when the callback is called, <em>this</em> will refer to the correct object.
So to rewrite our Cat example so they work correctly:
<pre>
class Cat 
{

    constructor(n,a)
    {
        this.theName=n;
        this.age=a;
    }

    meow()
    {
        alert(`${this.theName} says meow!`);
    }
}


// Runs when the page loads

// Create the cat
const tom = new Cat("Tom", 7);

// When the user clicks the button, the meow method will run
    document.getElementById("meowbtn").addEventListener("click", <em>tom.meow.bind(tom)</em>);

</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how the callback <em>tom.meow()</em> is now <em>bound</em> to the
object <em>tom</em>. This means that <em>this</em> will refer to the correct
object, <em>tom</em>, when <em>tom.meow()</em> is called as a callback on
response to a button click, or indeed any other event.</p>
