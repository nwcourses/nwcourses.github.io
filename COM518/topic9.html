<h1>Topic 9: Moving towards Modular Express Servers: Routing and Organising Code in Modules</h1>
</div>
In this topic we will start to look at how we can make our code more <em>modular</em> by writing <em>routers</em> and also how we can write middleware in <em>modules</em>. Specifically we will look at:
<ul>
<li>Using the Express <em>router</em> to organise and group routes;</li>
<li>Writing middleware in modules</li>
<li>dotenv for user settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Express Routers</h2>
<p>Having looked at modules, we will now look at how to implement an Express <em>router</em> as a module.</p>
<h3>Implementing an Express Router as a Module</h3>
<p>In a larger application, you will quickly find that your main Express file (often <code>app.mjs</code>) will become very large, handling a large number of routes. What you can do instead is to define a <em>Router</em>. A router allows you to set up a group of routes which match a particular path. For example we might create a router matching the path <em>/products</em> which will handle any routes beginning with <em>/products</em>, e.g: <em>/products/all</em>, <em>/products/id/:id</em> and so on. To do this we create a <em>routes</em> folder within the folder containing our main Express server, and place a route handler in there, which would be saved as a Node module (we looked at modules in <a href='topic5.html'>topic 5</a>.  Here is an example router module (<em>product.mjs</em>) which we would save in our <em>routes</em> folder:
<pre>
// routes/product.mjs 

import express from 'express';
const productRouter = express.Router();

productRouter.get('/all', (req,res)=&gt; {
    // code to return all products
});

productRouter.get('/id/:id', (req,res)=&gt; {
    // code to find the product with the given ID
});

export default productRouter; // export the module for external use
</pre>
Note how we are making <code>productRouter</code> the default export from this module, which means we'll be able to import it as follows:
<pre>import productRouter from './routes/product.mjs';</pre>
This is shown in the full Express application, below:
<pre>
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

// Import our product router module which we created above
import productRouter from './routes/product';

// Tell the app to use productRouter for all routes beginning with /products
// As we are using "use()", the router is acting as a middleware - see below
app.use('/products', productRouter);
app.listen(3000);
</pre>
So the song router is imported from the <em>routes/product</em> module
(corresponding to routes/product.mjs) and then we call <em>use()</em> 
with two arguments:
    <ul>
    <li><em>/products</em>, indicating that this router will <strong>handle all URLs beginning with <code>/products</code></strong>;</li>
    <li>The router object itself.</li>
    </ul>
So, the route <code>/products/all</code> will be handled via the product 
router (as the route begins with <code>/products</code>) and then via the <code>/all</code> route within the <code>products</code> router.</p>

<h2>Further Middleware</h2>
<p>Last time you were introduced to <em>middleware</em>. However, we wrote our middleware in our main <code>app.mjs</code> which is not ideal for <em>reusability</em>. We saw examples last week of standard middleware such as <code>express.json()</code> so it is valuable to write middleware in its own <em>modules</em> so that it can be imported into other projects. As an example we will look at a piece of <em>CORS</em> middleware.</p>
<p>Here is a piece of middleware which adds a <a href='topic3.html#cors'>CORS</a> header to all responses to allow clients from any domain to connect. In this example, the middleware is written directly inside <code>app.mjs</code>. 
<pre>
app.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {
    res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    next();
});
</pre> 
Note how we specify a custom arrow function as the argument to <code>use()</code>. This is our middleware, and you can see that it takes <code>req</code>, <code>res</code> and <code>next</code> parameters as described above. Note how our midleware <strong>adds the CORS <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header to the response object</strong> to allow any domain to connect, and then calls the next function in the middleware chain with <code>next()</code>.</p>
<p>However, we can write the middleware as a separate function, in a module, as long as it has the required <code>req</code>, <code>res</code> and <code>next</code> parameters. As we have seen, the advantage of this method is that your function can be placed inside a module and imported into other projects. Here is an example of writing our CORS middleware as a separate function in a module:
<pre>
// corsMiddleware.mjs
function corsMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    next();
}

export default corsMiddleware;
</pre>
We could then <code>import</code> this from our main server, and <code>use()</code> it, as follows:
<pre>import express from 'express';
const app = express();

// Require the middleware module
import corsMiddleware from './corsMiddleware';

// use() it
app.use(corsMiddleware);

// Routes
app.get('/', ...);

// etc

app.listen(3000);</pre>
</p>


<h2>dotenv - Environment variables</h2>
<p>Finally in this topic we will cover a useful Node module, <code>dotenv</code>. The <code>dotenv</code> module allows developers to specify <em>environment variables</em> - variables which can be set by the user as input to the application and may change - within a file, <code>.env</code>. Examples of such variables might include database name, username and password. This also has a security advantage: by adding private data to your <code>.env</code> it means that you can keep information such as passwords outside your source code, and publish your code to GitHub or another repository without giving away such information.</p>
<p><code>dotenv</code> is quite easy to use. Firsst of all, as it's a third-party module, you have to install it:
<pre>npm install dotenv</pre>
You then <code>import</code> it, for example below we import <code>dotenv</code> after we have initialised our Express app object.
<pre>
import express from 'express';
const app = express();
<em>import 'dotenv/config';</em>
</pre>
Environment variables are placed within the <code>.env</code> file as a series of key/value pairs. For example, here is a <code>.env</code> file containing database settings:
<pre>
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_DBASE=mysql
</pre>
We could then use these in our server via the <code>process.env</code> object. So we could use <code>process.env.DB_USER</code> to access the database user, <code>process.env.DB_HOST</code> to access the machine running the database, and <code>process.env.DB_DBASE</code> to access the database name. For example, if we were using MySQL, which requires a host, username and password, we could do:
<pre>
const con = mysql.createConnection({
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    database: process.env.DB_DBASE
});
</pre>
It's important to understand that <em>you can only use <code>process.env</code> after you have imported <code>dotenv</code></em>, as shown above.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>The exercise will allow you to practise with routers, middleware and <code>dotenv</code>.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This is a slightly more advanced topic, so you need to ensure you have completed the sessions and logins exercise from the previous topic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a <em>copy</em> of your Express serve from last weekr, so you still have the original version for reference.</li>
<li>Create a separate <em>router</em> file, containing routes for users (login, logout). This should be named <code>users.mjs</code>, should create an <code>express.Router()</code> as shown in the second example, and should contain the three routes (login POST, login GET and logout).</li>
<li>Include the router you have just created in your main Express app under the top-level route <code>/users</code>, as shown in the example.</li>
<li>As shown in the example with CORS, write the user-checking middleware (from last week) in a separate module as a function and export it. Then, <code>import</code> it and <code>use()</code> it in the main server file by specifying the name of the function exported from the module.</li>
<li>Test it out.</li>
<li>Now, similarly, move all your routes to handle songs (i.e. everything you did in week 2) to a separate router inside the file <code>songs.mjs</code>. In the same way that you did for your <code>users</code> router, include this router under the top-level route <code>/songs</code>, and test it by searching for all songs by a particular artist by requesting the correct URL in your browser.</li> 
<li>Install <code>dotenv</code> and <code>import</code> it in your main server application. Store the database name (e.g. wadsongs.db) in a .env file and alter your code so that it reads the database name from .env.</li>
</ol>
