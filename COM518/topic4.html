<h2>Querying and Manipulating HTML documents using the DOM</h2>
<p>So far we have looked at how to parse JSON returned from web APIs, and populate the front end with the data contained within the JSON. We have also looked at how to send POST requests to the server via AJAX. However, we can build more sophisticated front-end applications using other techniques. Next week you will be introduced to the <em>React</em> framework for front-end development, however this week we will start by taking a look at the underlying mechanism for page manipulation, the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>.</p>
<p>
Previously you've seen the <code>innerHTML</code> property which can be used to read, or change, the text within an HTML element. You've also looked at simple use of the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em> to access elements on a web page - specifically the use of <code>getElementById()</code> to access a specific 
page element using its ID.</p>
<p> However that's just the start: the DOM offers a whole range of ways to read and manipulate HTML pages or XML data. To understand how you can use DOM for document manipulation, you must understand the concept of <em>nodes</em>, which we will discuss below.  The examples below use the DOM to manipulate HTML documents, however, more generally, the DOM is used for accessing and manipulating XML documents. An HTML web page is a particular, specific type of XML document. So, as well as using the DOM to query and manipulate web pages, we can use it in a more general sense to query and manipulate XML. In AJAX, this latter use of the DOM is used extensively.</p> 

<h3>The Concept of Nodes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Part of the W3C Document Object Model (DOM)</li>
<li>A systematic way to navigate and manipulate the content of an HTML or XML document, not
only the <em>elements</em>, but also the <em>text within them</em></li>
<li>An HTML or XML document consists of a series of hierarchical <em>nodes</em></li>
<li>Each <em>element</em> (e.g <em>p</em>, <em>div</em>, or <em>em</em>
in HTML; or a custom tag in XML) is treated as a <em>node</em>
</li>
<li>However it's not just the elements themselves:
the <em>text</em> within each element is also treated as a special kind of node, a <em>text node</em></li>
<li>The nodes are a <em>nested</em>, <em>hierarchical</em> structure</li>

    <ul class="subpoint">
    <li>An element within an element is a <em>child node</em> of that element
    </li>
    </ul>

</ul>
<h3>Example of Nodes Terminology</h3>
<pre>&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Welcome to the <em>&lt;em&gt;wonderful!&lt;/em&gt;</em> world of dynamic text!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>

<li>The paragraph is a <em>child node</em> of the <em>body</em></li>

<li>The paragraph contains <strong>three</strong> of its own <em>child nodes</em>:</li>
    <ul>    
    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"Welcome to the"</em></li>
    <li>The <strong>em</strong> element</li>

    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"world of dynamic text!"</em></li>
    </ul>

<li>The <strong>em</strong> <em>itself</em> contains one child node:
    <ul>
    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"wonderful!"</em></li>

    <li>This is a child of the <strong>em</strong> not the 
    <strong>p</strong></li>
    </ul>
</li>

<h3>Adding a new node</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the keys to dynamic text</li>
<li><em>document.createElement()</em> allows us to <em>create a brand
new element!</em></li>

<li><em>document.createTextNode()</em> allows us to create a brand new
text node</li>
<li>Having created an element we can then populate it with text nodes
and child elements</li>
<li>... and finally add it to either:
    <ul>
    <li>The body</li>
    <li>Another element, which will act as its parent</li>
    </ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p>
<a href="examples/dom/node_add.html">Example</a>
</p>
<h3>Replacing an existing node</h3>
<ul>
<li>The other key to dynamic text</li>
<li>We can <em>replace a whole paragraph of text with another!!!</em></li>
<li>Steps:
    <ul>
    <li>Find the element to replace</li>
    <li>Create a new element (as per the previous example)</li>

    <li>Call <em>replaceChild()</em> to replace the old
    node with the new</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="examples/dom/node_replace.html">Example</a></p>
<h3>Getting all elements of a particular type</h3>
<ul>
<li>It can make it easier to find a page element if we can collect
together all elements of a particular type (e.g. all paragraphs)</li>

<li><em>document.getElementsByTagName()</em> allows us to do this
</li>
<li>This gives us an <em>array</em> of all elements of a particular
type, which we can then index</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="examples/dom/bytagname.html">Example</a></p>
<h3>Removing nodes</h3>
<ul>

<li>The final key concept of dynamic text is <em>removing</em> a particular
node</li>
<li>Use 
<pre>parentElement.removeChild(childElement)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Use IDs or <em>getElementByTagName()</em> once again to find
the element to remove</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other useful features of the DOM</h3>
<p>(Source:
<a href='http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html'>Quirksmode</a>, a very useful reference site for JavaScript
and the DOM)</p>

<ul>
<li><em>childNodes</em> property - an array of all the child nodes of a given node.e.g.:
<pre>
parent.childNodes.forEach ( childNode =&gt; {
    alert(childNode.nodeName); // show name of the node
});
</pre>
</li>
<li><em>firstChild</em> and <em>lastChild</em> properties - the first and last 
child node of a given node. e.g.
<pre>

// create a child node of the parent, assume that 'parent' has no children yet
const p = document.createElement("p");
parent.appendChild(p);

// create a text node
const textNode = document.createTextNode("some text");

// append it to the first child of the node 'parent', which will be the
// paragraph we created above. In other words 'p' and 'parent.firstChild'
// are the same in this case.
parent.firstChild.appendChild(textNode);
</pre>
</li>
<li> <em>document.querySelector()</em> 
and <em>document.querySelectorAll()</em> give the first
element, and all elements, which match a CSS selector respectively, eg
<pre>document.querySelectorAll(".important")</pre>
will give an array of all elements with a class of <em>important</em>.
See <a href="examples/dom/selector.html">Example</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inspecting elements</h3>
<p>The <em>inspect</em> functionality in the browser will help you see
what's going on - try it as you do the exercise for this week - right click on an element. Inspecting helps you to see the actual current DOM structure of the
page - including any dynamically-created elements.</p>
<h2 id="binding">Binding</h2>
<p>So far, we have been mostly using anonymous arrow functions as our 
event handlers, such as for button clicks. However, it's possible you might want to write a library of reusable JavaScript functions to perform certain tasks, and in this case, you would use named rather than anonymous functions. So you could have a function to like a product from a store, such as:
<pre>
function likeProduct(productID) {
    // send a request to the server to like the product with that ID
}
</pre>
You could then supply this function to a button's <code>addEventListener()</code> as a callback function, e.g.:
<pre>document.getElementById('likeButton').addEventListener("click", likeProduct);</pre>
This would indicate that <code>likeProduct()</code> would be called <strong>when the button is pressed, at some future point in time</strong>. However, how might you pass across the product ID? You might possibly think you could do something like this:
<pre>document.getElementById('likeButton').addEventListener("click", likeProduct(productID));</pre>
However, this code would be <em>wrong</em>. This code will call <code>likeProduct()</code> <strong>immediately</strong>, not when the button is pressed. Why?
When a function is specified with parentheses, e.g. <code>likeProduct(productID)</code>, it is <strong>immediately called</strong>. By contrast, <code>likeProduct</code> <em>without</em> parentheses merely supplies the function as an argument, without calling it. It will be called at some future point in time, i.e. when the button is clicked.</li>
<li>So how can we pass arguments to a callback?  We can do this by using <em>binding</em>. Binding allows us to bind specified arguments to a callback which will automatically be received when the function runs. This is easy to do, using JavaScript's <code>bind()</code> function. Here is an example:
<pre>document.getElementById('likeButton').addEventListener("click", likeProduct<strong>.bind(this, productID)</strong>);</pre>
Note how we call <code>bind()</code> on the callback function and pass across <code>this</code> followed by a list of arguments to be bound. <code>bind()</code> returns a new version of the callback, with the appropriate arguments bound. The first argument, <code>this</code> here, allows us to specify the context of <code>this</code> in the callback, which is mostly of use in object-oriented programming. See the <a href='thisandcallbacks.html'>advanced material below</a> for more detail.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p><strong>Ensure you have completed questions 1 to 4 from last week first.</strong></p>
<p>The main exercise is to add "Buy" functionality to your AJAX front-end
fron last week, so that a user can buy a given song. Songs will be bought by sending an AJAX POST request to the "buy" route of your web API.</p>
<p>Modify your AJAX front-end so that there is a "Buy" button for each search result. When the user clicks on the "Buy" button, you send an AJAX POST request to your "buy" route from week 1. To do this:
<h3>Standard Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>For each song (i.e. within the <code>forEach</code>), create a paragraph using <code>document.createElement()</code>, and set its <code>innerHTML</code> to the details of that song, taken from the JSON. 
The basic logic you are aiming for is:
<pre>
songs.forEach ( song =&gt; {
    // Create the paragraph 
    // Set the innerHTML of the paragraph to the song details
    // Add the paragraph to the &lt;div&gt; (question 2)
    // Create a "Buy" button, with event handler (question 3 onwards)
});
</pre>
</li>
<li>Using <code>appendChild()</code>, append that paragraph to the results <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Create a button using the DOM, specifically <code>document.createElement()</code> (see above). You should create an <code>input</code> element and set its <code>type</code> to <code>button</code> using <code>setAttribute()</code>, e.g:
<pre>const buttonElement = document.createElement("input"); 
buttonElement.setAttribute("type", "button");</pre>
</li>
<li>Specify the text on the button by setting its <code>value</code> with <code>setAttribute()</code>, in the same way that you set the <code>type</code> to <code>button</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>addEventListener()</code> to add an event handler to the button. The event handler should be an arrow function. We did this last week with AJAX. For example:
<pre>
//<strong>Note the arrow function needs to be async if we are using await</strong>
buttonElement.addEventListener ("click", async(e) =&gt; 
    { 
        // fill in your arrow function here.
        // It should call your "buy" web API route, passing in the ID of the current song.
    } 
);
</pre>
</li>
<li>In the button's event handler, send a POST request to the <code>buy</code> route on your server. Obtain the ID from the JSON returned from the search. <strong>For now, you do not need to pass any POST data as JSON to the route, just add the ID to the URL.</strong></li>
<li>Add the button you have created to your results &lt;div&gt; using <code>appendChild()</code> to append it.</li>
<li>Add code to the AJAX front end to handle HTTP status codes other than 200. If they occur, display an appropriate message to the user with <code>alert()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>More advanced questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In your Express server, modify your <code>buy</code> route from week 1 to allow the client to buy more than one copy of the song.  The quantity to buy should be passed to the server as JSON POST data within the request body. You'll need to change the UPDATE statement to reduce the quantity by the specified amount.</li>
<li>On the AJAX front end, using the DOM, add a <code>quantity</code> text field for each song, allowing the user to specify the quantity to buy. Give each text field an ID containing the song ID, e.g. <code>song445</code> for the song with the ID 445. Then, in the function which sends the AJAX POST request to the server, add code to read the quantity from the text field and send it as JSON POST data to the server.</li>
<li>Further modify your <code>buy</code> route so that it rejects the request with a 400 (Bad Request) error if the quantity requested from the client is 0 or less. Handle this error on the client with an <code>alert()</code> box.</li>
<li>Rewrite your code to use a separate <code>buySong()</code> function, called when the user presses the Buy button, using <code>bind()</code>.</li>
</ol>
