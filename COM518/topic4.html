<h1>Topic 4: Further AJAX: POST requests, DOM</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Last week we looked at AJAX and saw how to develop an AJAX front-end to
a web API which sends GET requests to the API and parses the JSON returned.
This week we will extend upon that by looking at how we can send <em>POST</em>
requests to a web API and use the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em> to
dynamically manipulate the page.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will look at:
    <ul>
    <li>How to retrieve an HTTP status code from an AJAX client;</li>
    <li>How to send POST requests from an AJAX client</li>
    <li>The Document Object Model (DOM)</li> 
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>More on the HTTP Response</h3>
<p>Remember in week 2 we discussed the concept of <em>HTTP status codes</em> and saw that REST APIs use these codes to communicate the success, or otherwise, of the operation to the client. For example 200 OK indicates the operation was successful, 404 Not Found might indicate that the item with the specified ID does not exist, or 400 Bad Request might indicate that the data sent to the server is fundamentally invalid. Here is the structure of an HTTP response:
<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59
Content-Type: application/json 
Content-Length: 59

{"song":"Life on Mars","artist":"David Bowie","year": 1973}
</pre>
Note how the HTTP response contains:
    <ul>
    <li>The status code, 200 here;</li>
    <li>The HTTP <em>headers</em>, including the content type, telling the client what type of data is being sent back, and the content length, telling the client how much data to expect.</li>
    <li>A blank line, followed by the actual requested content (here, some JSON representing Life On Mars by David Bowie).</li>
    </ul>
Here the content type is <code>application/json</code>; other types include <code>text/html</code> (for HTML) or <code>image/jpeg</code> for a JPEG image, to give two examples.</p>
<h3>Testing the HTTP status code from AJAX</h3>
<p>It is easy to test the HTTP status code from a web service client. If you are using AJAX you can simply use
the <em>status</em> property of the <em>response</em> object. For example, this
code will test for a 404: 
<pre>const response = await fetch('https://example.com/product/223');
if(response.status == 404) {
    alert("The product was not found!");
} else {
    const data = await response.json();
    // etc...
}</pre>
</p>
<h3>Sending POST requests from AJAX</h3>
<p>To send POST requests from AJAX, you need to create a POST request from
the fetch API and specify the data you want to send and the <code>Content-Type</code> header, much like you do in RESTer. Here is a code snippet which will send
a POST request to a <code>/newproduct</code> endpoint:
<pre>const product = {
    name: "Cornflakes",
    manufacturer: "Organic Products Ltd",
    price: 2.79
};

const response = await fetch('https://example.com/products/newproduct', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type' : 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(product)
});</pre>
Note how we send a <code>fetch()</code> request to the given URL, but this
time, we have to specify a number of options in a JavaScript object as a second argument to the <code>fetch()</code> function. These are:
    <ul>
    <li>the HTTP method (POST here);</li>
    <li>the HTTP headers we want to add to the request. This is itself a JavaScript object containing a series of property/value pairs, the properties being the header name and the value, its value. So here, we are setting the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>application/json</code>.</li>
    <li>The request body. This is a JSON string representing the data we want to send. Note that here, we create the JSON by specifying a JavaScript object <code>product</code>, containing product details, and then convert it to a JSON string with <code>JSON.stringify()</code>.
    </li>
    </ul>
In this example, the HTTP request sent by the code will look something like this:
<pre>POST /products/newproduct HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{"name":"Cornflakes","manufacturer":"Organic Products Ltd","price":2.79}
</pre>
Note how we specify the <code>Content-Type</code> in the <em>request</em> as an HTTP header, just like in the response. Also note how the JSON data is embedded within the request body, with a blank line separating the headers and the body, just as for the request. The <code>Content-Type</code> tells the <em>server</em> to expect JSON.</p>
<h2>Querying and Manipulating HTML documents using the DOM</h2>
<p>
Previously you've seen the <em>innerHTML</em> property which can be used to read, or change, the text within an HTML element. You've also looked at simple use of the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em> to access elements on a web page -
specifically the use of <em>getElementById()</em> to access a specific 
page element using its ID.</p>
<p> However that's just the start: the DOM offers a whole range of ways to read and manipulate HTML pages or XML data. To understand how you can use DOM for document manipulation, you must understand the concept of <em>nodes</em>, which we will discuss below.  The examples below use the DOM to manipulate HTML documents, however, more generally, the DOM is used for accessing and manipulating XML documents. An HTML web page is a particular, specific type of XML document. So, as well as using the DOM to query and manipulate web pages, we can use it in a more general sense to query and manipulate XML. In AJAX, this latter use of the DOM is used extensively.</p> 

<h3>The Concept of Nodes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Part of the W3C Document Object Model (DOM)</li>
<li>A systematic way to navigate and manipulate the content of an HTML or XML document, not
only the <em>elements</em>, but also the <em>text within them</em></li>
<li>An HTML or XML document consists of a series of hierarchical <em>nodes</em></li>
<li>Each <em>element</em> (e.g <em>p</em>, <em>div</em>, or <em>em</em>
in HTML; or a custom tag in XML) is treated as a <em>node</em>
</li>
<li>However it's not just the elements themselves:
the <em>text</em> within each element is also treated as a special kind of node, a <em>text node</em></li>
<li>The nodes are a <em>nested</em>, <em>hierarchical</em> structure</li>

    <ul class="subpoint">
    <li>An element within an element is a <em>child node</em> of that element
    </li>
    </ul>

</ul>
<h3>Example of Nodes Terminology</h3>
<pre>&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Welcome to the <em>&lt;em&gt;wonderful!&lt;/em&gt;</em> world of dynamic text!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>

<li>The paragraph is a <em>child node</em> of the <em>body</em></li>

<li>The paragraph contains <strong>three</strong> of its own <em>child nodes</em>:</li>
    <ul>    
    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"Welcome to the"</em></li>
    <li>The <strong>em</strong> element</li>

    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"world of dynamic text!"</em></li>
    </ul>

<li>The <strong>em</strong> <em>itself</em> contains one child node:
    <ul>
    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"wonderful!"</em></li>

    <li>This is a child of the <strong>em</strong> not the 
    <strong>p</strong></li>
    </ul>
</li>

<h3>Adding a new node</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the keys to dynamic text</li>
<li><em>document.createElement()</em> allows us to <em>create a brand
new element!</em></li>

<li><em>document.createTextNode()</em> allows us to create a brand new
text node</li>
<li>Having created an element we can then populate it with text nodes
and child elements</li>
<li>... and finally add it to either:
    <ul>
    <li>The body</li>
    <li>Another element, which will act as its parent</li>
    </ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p>
<a href="examples/dom/node_add.html">Example</a>
</p>
<h3>Replacing an existing node</h3>
<ul>
<li>The other key to dynamic text</li>
<li>We can <em>replace a whole paragraph of text with another!!!</em></li>
<li>Steps:
    <ul>
    <li>Find the element to replace</li>
    <li>Create a new element (as per the previous example)</li>

    <li>Call <em>replaceChild()</em> to replace the old
    node with the new</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="examples/dom/node_replace.html">Example</a></p>
<h3>Getting all elements of a particular type</h3>
<ul>
<li>It can make it easier to find a page element if we can collect
together all elements of a particular type (e.g. all paragraphs)</li>

<li><em>document.getElementsByTagName()</em> allows us to do this
</li>
<li>This gives us an <em>array</em> of all elements of a particular
type, which we can then index</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="examples/dom/bytagname.html">Example</a></p>
<h3>Removing nodes</h3>
<ul>

<li>The final key concept of dynamic text is <em>removing</em> a particular
node</li>
<li>Use 
<pre>parentElement.removeChild(childElement)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Use IDs or <em>getElementByTagName()</em> once again to find
the element to remove</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other useful features of the DOM</h3>
<p>(Source:
<a href='http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html'>Quirksmode</a>, a very useful reference site for JavaScript
and the DOM)</p>

<ul>
<li><em>childNodes</em> property - an array of all the child nodes of a given node.e.g.:
<pre>
parent.childNodes.forEach ( childNode =&gt; {
    alert(childNode.nodeName); // show name of the node
});
</pre>
</li>
<li><em>firstChild</em> and <em>lastChild</em> properties - the first and last 
child node of a given node. e.g.
<pre>

// create a child node of the parent, assume that 'parent' has no children yet
var p = document.createElement("p");
parent.appendChild(p);

// create a text node
var textNode = document.createTextNode("some text");

// append it to the first child of the node 'parent', which will be the
// paragraph we created above. In other words 'p' and 'parent.firstChild'
// are the same in this case.
parent.firstChild.appendChild(textNode);
</pre>
</li>
<li> <em>document.querySelector()</em> 
and <em>document.querySelectorAll()</em> give the first
element, and all elements, which match a CSS selector respectively, eg
<pre>document.querySelectorAll(".important")</pre>
will give an array of all elements with a class of <em>important</em>.
See <a href="examples/dom/selector.html">Example</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inspecting elements</h3>
<p>The <em>inspect</em> functionality in the browser will help you see
what's going on - try it as you do the exercise for this week - right click on an element. Inspecting helps you to see the actual current DOM structure of the
page - including any dynamically-created elements.</p>
<h2>Binding</h2>
<p>So far, we have been mostly using anonymous arrow functions as our 
event handlers, such as for button clicks. However, it's possible you might want to write a library of reusable JavaScript functions to perform certain tasks, and in this case, you would use named rather than anonymous functions. So you could have a function to like a product from a store, such as:
<pre>
function likeProduct(productID) {
    // send a request to the server to like the product with that ID
}
</pre>
You could then supply this function to a button's <code>addEventListener()</code> as a callback function, e.g.:
<pre>document.getElementById('likeButton').addEventListener("click", likeProduct);</pre>
This would indicate that <code>likeProduct()</code> would be called <strong>when the button is pressed, at some future point in time</strong>. However, how might you pass across the product ID? You might possibly think you could do something like this:
<pre>document.getElementById('likeButton').addEventListener("click", likeProduct(productID));</pre>
However, this code would be <em>wrong</em>. This code will call <code>likeProduct()</code> <strong>immediately</strong>, not when the button is pressed. Why?
When a function is specified with parentheses, e.g. <code>likeProduct(productID)</code>, it is <strong>immediately called</strong>. By contrast, <code>likeProduct</code> <em>without</em> parentheses merely supplies the function as an argument, without calling it. It will be called at some future point in time, i.e. when the button is clicked.</li>
<li>So how can we pass arguments to a callback?  We can do this by using <em>binding</em>. Binding allows us to bind specified arguments to a callback which will automatically be received when the function runs. This is easy to do, using JavaScript's <code>bind()</code> function. Here is an example:
<pre>document.getElementById('likeButton').addEventListener("click", likeProduct<strong>.bind(this, productID)</strong>);</pre>
Note how we call <code>bind()</code> on the callback function and pass across <code>this</code> followed by a list of arguments to be bound. <code>bind()</code> returns a new version of the callback, with the appropriate arguments bound. The first argument, <code>this</code> here, allows us to specify the context of <code>this</code> in the callback, which is mostly of use in object-oriented programming. See the <a href='#thisAndCallbacks'>advanced material below</a> for more detail.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p><strong>Ensure you have completed questions 1 and 2 from last week first.</strong></p>
<p>The main exercise is to add "Buy" functionality to your AJAX front-end
fron last week, so that a user can buy a given song. Songs will be bought by sending an AJAX POST request to the "buy" route of your web API.</p>
<p>Modify your AJAX front-end so that there is a "Buy" button for each search result. When the user clicks on the "Buy" button, you send an AJAX POST request to your "buy" route from week 1. To do this:
<h3>Standard Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>For each song (i.e. within the <code>forEach</code>), create a paragraph using <code>document.createElement()</code>, and set its <code>innerHTML</code> to the details of that song, taken from the JSON.</li>
<li>Using <code>appendChild()</code>, append that paragraph to the results <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Create a button using the DOM, specifically <code>document.createElement()</code> (see above). You should create an <code>input</code> element and set its <code>type</code> to <code>button</code> using <code>setAttribute()</code>, e.g:
<pre>
buttonElement.setAttribute("type", "button");
</pre>
</li>
<li>Specify the text on the button by setting its <code>value</code> with <code>setAttribute()</code>, in the same way thar you set the <code>type</code> to <code>button</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>addEventListener()</code> to add an event handler to the button. The event handler should be an arrow function. We did this last week with AJAX. For example:
<pre>
//<strong>Note the arrow function needs to be async if we are using await</strong>
buttonElement.addEventListener ("click", async(e) =&gt; 
    { 
        // fill in your arrow function here.
        // It should call your "buy" web API route, passing in the ID of the current song.
    } 
);
</pre>
</li>
<li>In the button's event handler, send a POST request to the <code>buy</code> route on your server. Obtain the ID from the JSON returned from the search. <strong>For now, you do not need to pass any POST data as JSON to the route, just add the ID to the URL.</strong></li>
<li>Add the button you have created to your results &lt;div&gt; using <code>appendChild()</code> to append it.</li>
<li>Add code to the AJAX front end to handle HTTP status codes other than 200. If they occur, display an appropriate message to the user with <code>alert()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>More advanced questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In your Express server, modify your <code>buy</code> route from week 1 to allow the client to buy more than one copy of the song.  The quantity to buy should be passed to the server as JSON POST data within the request body. You'll need to change the UPDATE statement to reduce the quantity by the specified amount.</li>
<li>On the AJAX front end, using the DOM, add a <code>quantity</code> text field for each song, allowing the user to specify the quantity to buy. Give each text field an ID containing the song ID, e.g. <code>song445</code> for the song with the ID 445. Then, in the function which sends the AJAX POST request to the server, add code to read the quantity from the text field and send it as JSON POST data to the server.</li>
<li>Further modify your <code>buy</code> route so that it rejects the request with a 400 (Bad Request) error if the quantity requested from the client is 0 or less. Handle this error on the client with an <code>alert()</code> box.</li>
<li>Rewrite your code to use a separate <code>buySong()</code> function, called when the user presses the Buy button, using <code>bind()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='thisAndCallbacks'>Advanced material - "this" and callbacks</h2>
<p>There are a number of subtleties with JavaScript <em>this</em> which you need to understand to work
effectively with objects, and which make its use
less straightforward than the use of <em>this</em> in other languages such as Java and C++. <strong>These subtleties are particularly important when it
comes to callbacks.</strong></p>
<h3>"this" and the window object</h3>
<p>Firstly, what does <em>this</em> refer to if it is not being used in the context of an object?
For example, if the function below was run, what would be displayed?
<pre>
function thisTest()
{
    alert(this);
}
</pre>
On Firefox it displays:
<pre>[object Window]</pre>
The output demonstrates what <em>this</em> refers to when out of the context of an object. It refers to a <em>"default object"</em> which in a web browser is the <em>window</em> object, representing
the browser window as a whole. So the example below would work too:
<pre>
function thisTest()
{
    window.alert("alert is actually a method of the window object!");
    this.alert("... and here, *this* refers to the window so this works too!");
}
</pre>
Both alerts are displayed. <em>alert()</em> is actually a method of the window object, but because
the window object is the environment's "default" object, we can normally leave <em>window</em> out;
it's included here just to illustrate the point. And
because <em>this</em> also refers to the window object in this context, the second alert will be
displayed too.</p>
<h3>"this" and callbacks - the problem</h3>
<p>The problem most commonly encountered with "this" is 
when it is being used in a <em>callback function</em>. As we have
seen, a <em>callback function</em> is a function that does not run immediately,
but at a later time, when some event has occurred (such as the user clicking a button,
or the response from an AJAX request is received). So imagine we had a Cat and we wanted it to meow if
we pressed a button, e.g:
<pre>
// cat.js
class Cat 
{

    constructor(n,a)
    {
        this.theName=n;
        this.age=a;
    }

    meow()
    {
        alert(`${this.theName} says meow!`);
    }
}



// Create the cat
const tom = new Cat("Tom", 7);

// When the user clicks the button, the meow method will run
document.getElementById("meowbtn").addEventListener("click", tom.meow);

</pre>
HTML:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='cat.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;input type='button' id='meowbtn' value='Meow!' /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>If you try this out, and click the button, does the expected output:
<pre>Tom says Meow!</pre>
occur? No. Instead, you will get something like:
<pre>undefined says Meow!</pre>
Why is this happening? 
<ul>
<li>On a simple level, it is because <em>callback functions do not keep track of the object that
the method relates to.</em> So when we click the button, the meow function will be called but
the fact that it relates to the object <em>tom</em> is not retained. So when we try to display
<em>theName</em> of the current object, we get <em>undefined</em> because the current object
is not <em>tom</em> and hence has no <em>theName</em> property</li>
<li>To explain in more depth: <em>when we are using a callback function, the context of
the function changes</em>. In this example, we are basically setting the <em>click</em>
event handler of the button to be the meow method of the object <em>tom</em>. But the object
<em>tom</em> itself is <em>not</em> copied across. Instead, the code in <em>meow()</em> is copied
across to the button object, and becomes the <em>click</em> method of the button object. So,
when we click the button, <em>this</em> is actually the button object! Buttons do not have a
<em>theName</em> property, so we get <em>undefined</em>.</li>
<li>Note that <em>arrow functions always preserve the context of this</em>
so we don't have the same sort of problem if we use an arrow function as a 
callback. However, frequently we want to make a method of a class or object a callback function, as 
we have done here. In these cases, we are forced to deal with the
the "context of this" problem and ensure that <em>this</em> refers to
the correct object in the callback.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Dealing with "this" issues in callbacks with bind()</h3>
<p>Luckily, the issue is easy to deal with.
You can simply use the <em>bind()</em> method.
<em>bind()</em> does what it says on the tin: it binds the callback function to the specified
object, so that when the callback is called, <em>this</em> will refer to the correct object.
So to rewrite our Cat example so they work correctly:
<pre>
class Cat 
{

    constructor(n,a)
    {
        this.theName=n;
        this.age=a;
    }

    meow()
    {
        alert(`${this.theName} says meow!`);
    }
}


// Runs when the page loads

// Create the cat
const tom = new Cat("Tom", 7);

// When the user clicks the button, the meow method will run
    document.getElementById("meowbtn").addEventListener("click", <em>tom.meow.bind(tom)</em>);

</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how the callback <em>tom.meow()</em> is now <em>bound</em> to the
object <em>tom</em>. This means that <em>this</em> will refer to the correct
object, <em>tom</em>, when <em>tom.meow()</em> is called as a callback on
response to a button click, or indeed any other event.</p>
</body>
</html>
