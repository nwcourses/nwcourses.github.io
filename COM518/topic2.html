<div class="titlebox"><h1>Topic 2: More on Web APIs</h1></div>
<p>This week we will look at a few more Web API-related topics, including:
	<ul>
	<li>Databases as a client-server system</li>
	<li>More detail on REST</li>
	<li>Sending data to a server through the request body with POST and PUT requests</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>Databases as a client-server system</h2>
<p>We are using SQLite in this module. However in production web applications, you typically use a full <em>database server</em>, such as MySQL or Oracle. We will not be using a database server in this module, but it's helpful to be clear of their architecture as you will likely work with it in a production app. Server-based database systems consist of two components, the <em>server</em> and
the <em>client</em>:
<br/>

<br />
<h3>The database server</h3>
<p>A database <em>server</em> is what we refer to when we informally use the term "database software". It is a continuously-running program which <em>listens</em> to SQL queries from clients, processes them and sends back a <em>response</em>; in this respect, a database server is just like any other server, including a web server.</p>
<p>Examples of database servers include:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Free, open source</strong>: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial</strong>: Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>The database client</h3>
<p>Users do not typically interact directly with the database server. Instead, they interact with a <em>database client</em> - a piece of software which communicates with the database server by connecting to it, sending SQL queries, and processing the response. When developing web applications, your software (for example, your Node.js server) would act as the database client. Additionally, a wide range of administration software for database servers is available, allowing developers to control the database via a user-friendly interface. These include:
    <ul>
    <li>PHPMyAdmin (web-based interface to MySQL)</li>
    <li><code>mysql</code> command line tool (command-prompt-based interface to MySQL)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Three-tier architecture</h3>
<p>Database-driven web applications adopt a <em>three-tier architecture</em>. This is because there are three layers: web browser (which the user interacts with), web server (e.g. Node.js or Apache/PHP), and database server.
The web server acts as the <em>server</em> with respect to the 
user's web browser, but the <em>client</em> with respect to the database server:
<br/>
<img src="../images/db2_language_independent.png" alt="Clients, servers, scripts and databases"/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>The general steps made by a web server application when connecting to a database server are:
<ol>
<li>Connect to the database</li>
<li>Send a query to the database</li>
<li>Receive the results from the database</li>
<li>Send the results, formatted in HTML, back to the browser</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>REST - Representational State Transfer - more detail</h2>

<p>We started to look at Representational State Transfer, or REST, last week - but this week we will discuss it in more detail. REST is not a technology, but
<em>an architecture for web APIs</em>. The idea centres around using clear, highly-descriptive
URLs to represent each <em>real-world entity</em> that our web application needs to deal with 
(e.g. a song, a list of all songs by a given artist, a flight, a 
biography of an actor, etc). For example we could have these URLs:
<pre>
http://www.hittastic.com/artist/Oasis
http://www.hittastic.com/biography/Madonna
http://www.solentairways.com/flight/SA101
http://www.solentairways.com/flights/June/1/Southampton/New_York
</pre>
</p>
<p>In REST, these URLs are called <em>resources</em>.
REST has the following key principles:
    <ul>
    <li>Use of clear, unchanging and descriptive
    URLs to represent real-world items or entities(as in the example above);</li>
      <li>The URL should produce the data expected of it, e.g 
    <em>http://www.solentairways.com/flight/SA101</em> should return data representing
    Solent Airways flight SA101</li>
    <li>The ability to send different instructions to the URL to make it behave in different
    ways, i.e. we can send a URL one type of instruction to retrieve data and another type
    to modify data associated with that URL.</li>
    <li>Statelessness</li> 
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Clean and unchanging URLs</h3>
<p>A key principle of REST, illustrated by the examples above,
is that of <em>clean, unchanging URLs</em>. Why is this useful?
URLs which show the real location on the server, or the server-side
technology used (e.g. the fact that it's a PHP 
script) are prone to continuous change, for example, if the script is moved
to a different directory or we switch server-side scripting technology.
This causes problems in bookmarking and linking to such pages, and also,
if the URLs represent web APIs, means that developers of client 
applications have to update their client code to point to the new URL.</p>
<p>With REST, we hide the implementation details with a simple, clean and
easily-remembered URL, and define how this URL is <em>mapped</em> to the
real, underlying location of the script on the server. 
For example, rather than a style (which should be familiar from OODD) such as
<pre>http://www.hittastic.com/searchForMusic.jsp?title=Wonderwall&amp;artist=Oasis</pre>
we could use:
<pre>http://www.hittastic.com/Oasis/Wonderwall</pre>
The web server software would convert this REST-style URL to the real, underlying script.</p>
<p>If we changed the underlying URL, i.e. the location of the actual server
side script on the server, all we'd need to do is change the mapping
of our clean, easily remembered, publicly-visible, "REST-style" URL to the real underlying URL, 
and clients of the web API could continue to use our web API unchanged with the same 
publicly-visible URL as before; they wouldn't have to alter their
code to reflect the new underlying URL. We could even change the 
server-side implementation technology (e.g. PHP to ASP) without having
to change the publicly-visible URL: once again we would only have to change
the mapping from the publicly-visible URL to the underlying URL.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this allows us to easily 
 <em>swap between dynamically and statically generated data</em>. Imagine the 
 URL
below points at a static (i.e. not dynamically generated) JSON file on the server representing all Oasis hits.
<pre>
http://www.hittastic.com/artist/Oasis
</pre>
By changing the server configuration, we could easily change this URL to point to a server side script which
dynamically generates the data from a database. So in summary, <em>REST style URLs provide a clean and
unchanging interface to data supplied by our server</em> and there is <em>no need to change the URL depending
on how the data associated with that URL is generated</em>.
</p>
<p>The practical details of how to actually set up REST-style URLs to point to given
scripts will be discussed towards the end of this week's notes.</p>
<h3>REST and HTTP</h3>
<p>With REST, we send <em>different types of messages</em> to <em>the same URL</em> to make it
do different things, e.g. retrieve data or change the state of the item represented by the URL. 
For example if we had the URL:
<pre>
http://www.solentairways.com/flight/SA101
</pre>
we could send one type of message (let's call it a "get" message)
to to the URL to retrieve the details about flight SA101, and another type
of message (let's call it a "put" message)
to update the details (e.g. departure time) of flight SA101, 
and a third type (let's call it a "delete" message) to delete flight SA101.</p>
<p>But what form do these messages take? We could use query string
parameters to inform the script of the message type. However, like custom
error codes, this could be seen as reinventing the wheel.
Last week we looked at <em>HTTP methods</em> and encountered the recommendation
to send GET requests when retrieving data or POST requests when adding or modifying
data. REST combines this concept in conjunction with the "one URL per real world entity"
concept already introduced. So you could send a GET request to the <em>SA101</em> URL above
to retrieve data about flight SA101, or a POST request to modify data about SA101.</p>
<p>However, in addition to GET and POST,
REST uses a couple of <em>additional</em> and less-commonly-encountered
HTTP methods: <em>PUT</em> and <em>DELETE</em>. In REST, <em>PUT</em> differs from <em>POST</em> in that PUT is used to <em>modify</em> data while POST is used to <em>add</em> new data. DELETE requests, unsurprisingly, are used to delete data.</p>
<p>REST takes the view that HTTP methods and status codes are under-used
and can be exploited in web APIs, as described below.</p>
<h4>REST and HTTP methods</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, the idea is that one single web resource (URL) can be used for retrieving, 
adding, and deleting data associated with a particular item, e.g. a 
particular song in the HitTastic! database. What we can do is to do different
things with the song depending on the type of HTTP method we use to 
communicate with the URL. In general we:
    <ul>
    <li>Use the GET method to retrieve data associated with a URL;</li>
    <li>Use the PUT method to modify data associated with a URL;</li>
    <li>Use the DELETE method to delete data associated with a URL;</li>
    <li>Use the POST method to create a brand new server resource e.g. a new song.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>REST and statelessness</h3>
<p>Another feature of REST is <em>statelessness</em>, which involves not storing application state (such as sessions) on the server but instead passing it between server and client. This makes each API endpoint more <em>loosely-coupled</em>: it does not depend on a previous endpoint which might have stored application state in a session. Many contemporary web applications do this, for example rather than storing the username on the server, authentication is done via <em>tokens</em> which are passed between server and client.</p>
<h2>Sending data to the server via the request body</h2>
<p>With POST requests, we often need to <em>send data to the server</em>, for example when creating a new product in a products database for a shop, we might need to send the name, manufacturer and price. This is done by <em>embedding the data in the request body</em>, often as JSON, but also as key-value pairs. Last week we considered HTTP requests. Let's see
an example of an HTTP POST request with embedded data:
<pre>
POST /product/create HTTP/1.1
Host: www.solent-e-stores.com
Content-Type: application/json

{"name":"Corn Flakes","manufacturer":"Smith Emporium","price":1.29}  
</pre>
Note how we are sending <em>POST</em> data to <code>/product/create</code> and note how the HTTP <em>request</em> has a <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>application/json</code> (we covered MIME types last week). This is now telling the <em>server</em> (not the client) that what is being sent is JSON.</p>
<p>Note also how the <em>request body</em> begins after the headers, with a gap
of one line. Note here, how the request body contains a JSON object containing
details of a product.</p>
<p>How can we read the request body from an Express application? 
When you wish to access the request body in your routes, you use
the <code>req.body</code> object. Here is an example of a 
<code>/product/create</code> route which reads JSON from the request body
and performs an SQL INSERT statement with it:
<pre>
app.use(express.json()); // necessary to read JSON data from the request body

app.post('/product/create', (req, res) =&gt; {
    try {
        const stmt = db.prepare('INSERT INTO products(name, manufacturer, price) VALUES (?,?,?)');

        const info = stmt.run(req.body.name, req.body.manufacturer, req.body.price);
        res.json({id: info.lastInsertRowid});
    } catch(error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: error });
    }
});
</pre>
Note how the <code>info</code> object has a <code>lastInsertRowid</code> property representing the primary key (ID) allocated to the new record. So if the operation was successful, we send back JSON containing the ID, which can then be used by the client.</p>
<h3>PUT requests</h3>
<p>When you are sending data to the server through the request body which is intended to <em>update</em> a record, you should, according to the principles of REST, use a <em>PUT</em> request. PUT requests work in a very similar way to POST requests: data is read from the request body and then used to update data. For example, this is a PUT endpoint which can be used to update a student's name and course:
<pre>
app.put('/student/:id', (req, res) =&gt;{
    try {
        const stmt = db.prepare('UPDATE students SET name=?,course=? WHERE id=?');
        const info = stmt.run(req.body.name, req.body.course, req.params.id);
        res.status(info.changes ? 200:404).json({success: info.changes ? true: false});
    } catch(error) {
        res.status(500).json({error: error});
    }
});
</pre>
</p>
<h3>URL-encoded form data</h3>
<p>JSON is not the only way to send data to the server via the request body. In classic, non-AJAX applications, data is sent as <em>URL-encoded form data</em>: a series of key-value pairs separated by the ampersand character (&amp;). In OODD you looked at forms with a method of <em>POST</em>, e.g.:
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Add a student&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Add a student record&lt;/h1&gt;


        &lt;form action="./addStudent.jsp" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Student name:&lt;input type="text" name="studentName" value="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Student course:&lt;input type="text" name="studentCourse" value="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Student mark:&lt;input type="text" name="studentMark" value="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Student type:
            &lt;select name='studentType'&gt;
            &lt;option&gt;Undergraduate&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option&gt;Masters&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;/select&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Register student!" /&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt; 
        &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
Remember we had a form with fields for name, course, mark and student type. How is this actually sent to the server? The HTTP POST request looks something like this:
<pre>POST ./addStudent.jsp HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

studentName=Tim&amp;studentCourse=Computing&amp;studentMark=80&amp;studentType=undergraduate</pre>
Note how the student details are sent through the HTTP request as a series of key-value pairs, with the keys corresponding to the form field names and the values corresponding to the details the user entered. Also note the <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, which tells the server that it is receiving URL-encoded form data, rather than JSON.
</p>
<p>An Express server can interpret URL-encoded form data and place it in <code>req.body</code> by adding the line:
<pre>app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}));</pre>
</p>
<h3>Testing HTTP POST and PUT requests which accept data in the request body</h3>
<p>You can once again use RESTer or REST Tester to do this. Importantly, you must <em>tell the server the content type of the request being sent</em>. This is done by specifying the content type of the <em>request</em> (rather than the response). For example, if you are sending JSON through the request body, you must set the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>application/json</code>. This is how the server knows that JSON is being sent to it, and thus can process it appropriately.</p>
<h4>RESTer</h4>
<p>The screenshot below shows how you can add headers to the HTTP request by selecting the <em>Headers</em> tab. Here we have specified the <code>Content-Type</code> as <code>application/json</code>:
<br />
<img src="../images/rester2.png" alt="Setting content type in RESTer" />
<br />
You can also add data to the request body. This is shown below, note how we have added JSON describing a song. (Prize to anyone who can guess why I have chosen this particular song...)
<br />
<img src="../images/rester3.png" alt="Setting request body in RESTer" />
<br />
RESTer also allows you to test error conditions: if you supply invalid 
request data and your web API checks for this, then you will get a non-200
status code returned.</p>
<h4>REST Tester</h4>
<p>REST Tester also allows you to send POST data through the request body, as you should be able to easily see from the interface. You must also set the content type of the request.
