<div class="titlebox"><h1>Topic 1: Introduction to JSON Web APIs</h1>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this week's topic you will be introduced to the concept of
<strong>web APIs</strong>. You will get an initial idea of why they are useful, and will start to write a simple web API using Node.js and Express. You will also be introduced to <em>goormIDE</em>, a cloud-based environment which you can use to develop Node applications.</p>

<h2>Is HTML always the best output format?</h2>
<p>Think about the work you did last year in Web Technologies, in which you wrote a simple Node/Express server to search a database table and display the results using EJS. You generated <em>HTML</em> as the output format, so that the results look good in a browser.</p>
<p>The problem with HTML, however, is that it is a format <em>specific to a browser</em>. This is fine if we are simply writing a website to be viewed by an end-user in a browser. But the end-user is not the only potential user of the data. <em>Other applications</em> might want to make use of the content, for example a weather app running on Android or iOS might want to access weather forecasts from a weather website. Apps do not typically use HTML, they use their own user interface, so it would be better if our server delivered the data as <em>raw data</em>, without any presentation or formatting. An example of a raw data format is <em>JSON</em>, which you saw last year in COM419. Raw data could then be easily processed by <em>any front end</em>, for example:
    <ul>
    <li>An AJAX application. As you saw last year, AJAX applications send requests to servers, and in many cases, the server sends back raw data, such as JSON, which can then be <em>parsed</em> and integrated into the AJAX front-end.</li>
    <li>A smartphone app, as we have seen.</li>
    <li>A third-party website, which might want to use data provided by our server. For example, a tourist website for a particular city might want to display a weather forecast for that city, using a server which provides weather information. This would be easier if the weather server sent back raw data, rather than HTML. With HTML, the relevant data (the weather forecast) would have to be extracted from an HTML page (containing formatting, styling etc) which would be difficult to parse compared to concise, well-structured raw data such as JSON.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Web APIs - Introduction</h2>
<p>
A <em>web API</em> is an application running on a web server which provides <em>raw data</em> (such as JSON) to other applications (<em>client applications</em>), as we saw above. Web APIs receive HTTP requests from clients, process the request, and deliver the response back as an HTTP response - but unlike the simple servers you saw last year, the response is delivered as raw data, rather than HTML. This is shown on the diagram below:
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/web_apis_json.png" alt="JSON web APIs" />
</p>
<p> Here are a few examples of web APIs and their clients:

<ul>
<li>
<em>Flights:</em>
An airline provides flight times and a booking service available on its own website. However, other organisations might wish to make use of this. Third-party sites such as Skyscanner (which can search all airlines for the cheapest flight on a given date) or travel agents may wish to use the information provided by the airline, and display it to the end-user. In these cases, code on the Skyscanner web server, or a standalone booking application at a travel agent (which might be written in Java, for example) might connect to the airline's web API, and receive flight information back. The clients (Skyscanner and the travel agent application) could also contact the web API to perform bookings.
</li>
<li>
<em>Weather:</em> We mentioned this example above, briefly. A weather web API might make available current conditions in various cities around the world. Then, a tourism website (e.g. for London or Paris) could connect to the weather web API and display the current conditions in that city, retrieved from the web API, integrated seamlessly into the layout of its own site. Furthermore, a smartphone app could connect to the web API and show the weather for the user's current location within the app's interface.
</li>

<li>
<em>Mapping:</em>
electronic maps are typically stored in a database, which contains information about the roads (name, number, type) plus the road's route as a series of coordinates (representing points on the Earth's surface).  A mapping web API could make available this mapping information as raw data, so that client websites could use this raw data to draw a map in their own style and colour scheme. OpenStreetMap (<a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>openstreetmap.org</a>) is an example of such a mapping web API.
</li>
</ul>

</p>


<h3>Raw data is easier to parse</h3>

<p>
Web APIs obviously send back information to their clients, but as we have seen, a raw data format such as JSON is preferred to HTML. Why is this? HTML is not considered a good idea because it contains not only data, but also page structure information (headings, paragraphs, tables etc). A client website using the web API, or an app, might wish to arrange the information in a different way. </p>
<p>So what we want is a format which represents the data, and the data alone. There are a number of formats we can use, including JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and also <em>XML</em> (eXtensible Markup Language). In this module we will focus on JSON, because it's the leading format, it is easy to generate on the server and to parse (interpret) on the client, and you have met it already.</p>
<h3>JSON - JavaScript Object Notation - Revision</h3>
<p>JSON uses JavaScript syntax (hence the name) to represent data as it gets sent across the web. As you saw last year, JavaScript uses curly brackets {} to represent objects (similar to Python dictionaries in the sense that they consist of key/value pairs, though you can also add <em>methods</em> to objects) and square brackets [] to represent arrays. So with JSON we reuse this syntax to represent data, using curly brackets {} to represent a single entity (such as a person, a song or a film) and square brackets [] to represent a collection of entities (i.e. an <em>array</em> of entities).</p>
<p>Here is an example of a JSON object representing a single student.
<pre>
{ 
    "name": "Tim Smith",
    "username": "2smitt82",
    "course": "Computer Studies"
}
</pre>
Note how the JSON object representing the student is defined by curly brackets { and }, and inside the curly bracket, we specify each property of the student (name, username and course) and the corresponding value ("Tim Smith", "2smitt82", and "Computer Studies", respectively). A colon (:) 
separates the property and the value, and a comma separates each property/value pair.</p>
<p>The next example shows a <em>collection (array) of students</em>. Note how we use the JSON array syntax [ and ] to
define the collection, how each individual student object is represented by curly brackets { and }, and
how each student object within the array is separated by a comma.
<pre>
[
    { 
      "name": "Tim Smith",
      "username": "2smitt82",
      "course": "Computer Studies"
    },

    {
      "name": "Jamie Bailey",
      "username": "1bailj39",
      "course": "Computer Studies"
    },

    {
      "name": "Deep Patel",
      "username": "0pated61",
      "course": "Networks and Web Design"
    }
]
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Node and Express - Revision</h2>
<p>In other modules you have looked at <em>Node.js</em> and <em>Express</em>. This section is provided for revision. Node.js can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">the website</a>.</p>

<h3>npm</h3>

<p>As you have seen, Node also comes with a <em>package manager</em> called <em>npm</em>. This allows you to use add-ons to Node (<em>packages</em>) which perform additional tasks, not part of the core Node.js distribution, such as communicating with a database. To use npm to install new packages, you enter:
 <pre>npm install &lt;packagename&gt;</pre>
 at the command-line (e.g. DOS or Linux shell prompt).</p>
<h3>API documentation</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/">here</a> for full Node API
documentation.</p>
<h3>Creating a Node web server Using Express</h3>
<p>It is possible to create a webserver from first principles in Node, using the HTTP module. However, as you have seen in previous modules, it's easier to use a pre-existing web server framework, and <em>Express</em> is perhaps the most widely used. The <code>npm</code> command below will install it: 
<pre>npm install express</pre>
This will install it locally to your current project. Or to install it globally
so that it's accessible anywhere on your machine, for all projects and all 
users:
<pre>npm install -g express</pre>
On Linux and other Unix-based systems, this requires 'sudo' rights (admin privileges).</p>
<h3>Hello World with Express</h3>
<p>The example below is the Hello World with Express. Note that there are two ways of including third-party modules such as Express: <strong>CommonJS modules</strong> and <strong>ECMAScript 6 modules</strong>. The latter is the currently-recommended approach and is a standard part of recent JavaScript. The difference when coding is that you use <code>require()</code> with CommonJS modules, but <code>import</code> with ECMAScript 6 modules. <strong>Note that if you use ECMAScript 6 modules in Node.js, you must save the file with a .mjs extension, not .js.</strong>.
<pre>
// app.mjs - use .mjs extension as ECMAScript 6 modules are used

import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req,res)=&gt; {
    res.send('Hello World from Express!');
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
We <code>import</code> the <code>express</code> module, then create an Express
app object with <code>express()</code>.</p>
<p>With Express, we set up <em>routes</em>. A route is a combination of a particular URL and a handler function for that URL. The URLs for a particular API are called <em>API endpoints</em>. So a route can be described as a handler for a particular endpoint, or set of endpoints (we can set up a single route to handle multiple URLs). In this example we are simply handling the top level, 'root' endpoint, so to request it from a browser, we would enter: 
<pre>http://localhost:3000/</pre>
without any parameters supplied.</p>
<p>The handler for the endpoint is a function which takes two parameters,
<code>req</code> representing the HTTP request and <code>res</code> representing the
HTTP response. In this example we call the <code>send()</code> method of the
response object to send back <em>Hello World from Express!</em> to the 
client.</p>
<h3>Running the server</h3>
<p>Remember that you use the <code>node</code> command to run a Node application. So if the above basic Express app is saved as <code>app.mjs</code>, you would run it with:
<pre>node app.mjs</pre>
This will run the server continuously in the background. To stop the server, you need to press <code>Control-C</code>. You must do this if you change the server code as the server will not automatically reload if you change it!
</p>
<h3 id='basicroutes'>Multiple routes - example</h3>
<p>Here is an example which sets up two separate routes:
<pre>
import express from 'express';
const app = express();


app.get('/hello', (req,res)=&gt; {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});


app.get('/time', (req,res)=&gt; {
    res.send(`There have been ${Date.now()} milliseconds since 1/1/70.`);
});
app.listen(3000);
</pre>
This example sets up two routes <code>/hello</code> and <code>/time</code>, to handle the corresponding endpoints. The first will send back 'Hello World!' and the second will send back the number of milliseconds since January 1st 1970. 
</p>
<p>Note that the <code>/time</code> route uses the <em>backtick syntax</em>, which may be new to you. If we use backticks (`) for strings, we can <em>embed expressions directly in the string by surrounding the expression with curly brackets { } and preceding the curly brackets with a dollar sign $</em>. This avoids us having to use string concatenation with the + operator and leads to more concise syntax. So note how we embed the expression <code>Date.now()</code>, which gets the current time in milliseconds, in the string by surrounding it with curly brackets and preceding it with a dollar sign:
<pre>`There have been ${Date.now()} milliseconds since 1/1/70.`</pre>
</p>

<h3>URL parameters</h3>
<p>Express allows us to easily specify URL parameters. A parameter is a value within a URL which the server will process. So for example we might have an <code>/artist</code> route which takes an artist as a parameter. This route would match both of the endpoints below; <code>Oasis</code> and <code>Madonna</code> are the parameters to the same <code>/artist</code> route.
<pre>
http://localhost:3000/artist/Oasis
http://localhost:3000/artist/Madonna
</pre>
You set up the route to contain named parameters and
then you can use these named parameters in your JavaScript. This example 
greets a user, with the name supplied as a parameter:
<pre>
import express from 'express';
const app = express();


app.get('/greet/:personName', (req,res)=&gt; {
    res.send(`Hello ${req.params.personName}!`);
});


app.listen(3000);
</pre>
Note how this will setup the route <code>/greet</code> followed
by a parameter <code>:personName</code>
representing a person name. So URLs such as
<pre>
http://localhost:3000/greet/John
http://localhost:3000/greet/Jane
</pre>
will be matched, and the greeting with the specified name will be sent back. These two examples will respond with:
<pre>Hello John!
Hello Jane!</pre>
respectively.
</p>
<p>
To access the named parameter from the JavaScript code, use the <code>req.params</code> object with the name of the parameter.
So in this example <code>req.params.personName</code>
will reference the <code>:personName</code> parameter and the server will send back a response containing "Hello" plus the person name supplied as a parameter.</p>
<h2>Outputting JSON from an Express server</h2>
<p>Having covered some basic Node/Express revision, we will now look at how we can <em>generate JSON</em> from an Express server.</p>
<p>
Here is an example to generate JSON from a JavaScript array. To send back JSON to the client, we use <code>res.json()</code> rather than <code>res.send()</code>. Remember that in JavaScript we use the square brackets [ and ] to define arrays.
<pre>
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.get('/jsonExample', (req, res) =&gt; {
    const monthLengths = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];
    res.json(monthLengths);
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
This will produce the JSON below when the <code>jsonExample</code> endpoint is requested:
<pre>
[ 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 ]
</pre>
</p>
<p>Here is an example showing an <em>object</em>: 
<pre>
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.get('/jsonExample2', (req, res) =&gt; {
    const obama = {"name" : "Barack Obama",
                    "age" : 56,
                    "nationality" : "US",
                    "job" : "US President 2008-16" };
    res.json(obama);
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
This would give the JSON below when the <code>jsonExample2</code> endpoint is requested:
<pre>
{"name" : "Barack Obama", "age" : 56, "nationality" : "US", "job": "US President 2008-16"}
</pre>
and finally here is an example showing an array of objects: 
<pre>
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

const politicians = [

       {
        "name" : "Barack Obama",
        "age" : 56,
        "nationality" : "US",
        "job" : "US President 2008-16" 
       },

       {
        "name" : "Donald Trump",
        "age" : 75,
        "nationality" : "US",
        "job" : "US President 2016-20" 
       },
            
       {
        "name" : "Joe Biden",
        "age" : 79,
        "nationality" : "US",
        "job" : "US President 2020-" 
       }
                     
];

app.get('/jsonExample3', (req, res) =&gt; {
    res.json(politicians);
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
This will produce this JSON when the <code>jsonExample3</code> endpoint is requested:
<pre>
[
    {
        "name" : "Barack Obama", 
        "age" : 56, 
        "nationality" : "US", 
        "job": "US President 2008-16"
    },
    {
        "name" : "Donald Trump", 
        "age" : 75, 
        "nationality" : "US",  
        "job": "US President 2016-20" 
    },
    {
        "name" : "Joe Biden", 
        "age" : 79, 
        "nationality" : "US",  
        "job": "US President 2020-" 
    }
]
</pre>
The simple rule is that JavaScript arrays will map to JSON arrays, and JavaScript objects will map to JSON objects.</p>
<h3>Setting the correct content type</h3>
<p>A server should let clients know that JSON is coming back from the server, so that the client knows that they need to process the response as JSON, rather than something else.  For example, web browsers will format the JSON nicely to make it easier to test and debug a web API. To do this the <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header must be set to <code>application/json</code>. <em>The great thing if you are using Express, however, is that <code>res.json()</code> will set the content type correctly for you.</em></p>
<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE the following</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li>To test, you may need to install the JSONViewer plugin, from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en"> the Chrome web store</a>. This will format the JSON nicely so it's easy to see the output.</li>
    <li>Some of these may be very easy if you have done the database module last term. So feel free to skip Questions 1, 2 and 4 if you are confident with them: they are mostly intended for revision for those of you who have not done any Node since your first-year module. (You will need question 3 for later exercises, so please complete it even if you consider it very easy).</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>On your local machine, create the simple Hello World Express example above. Run it, and request it from your browser to show that it works.</li>
<li>Add the <code>/time</code> route from the second example, and again request it from your browser. Refresh your browser to prove that the number of milliseconds increases as time passes.</li>
<li>Add an <em>artist</em> route to your server.
The <em>artist</em> route should take parameter for the artist
name and the application should respond to the request with a message displaying the artist the user requested. So, if the user requested:
<pre>http://localhost:3000/artist/Oasis</pre> 
it should send back the message 
<pre>You are searching for songs by Oasis</pre>
</li>
<li>Make the application also respond to URLs of this form:
<pre>http://localhost:3000/artist/(the artist)/song/(the song)</pre>
by specifying parameters for both artist and song. So, for example, if the user requested:
<pre>http://localhost:3000/artist/Oasis/song/Wonderwall</pre>
it would send back: 
<pre>You are searching for Wonderwall by Oasis</pre>
</li>
<li>You are now going to create a route which <em>generates JSON</em>. In your Express application, at the start of the script (<em>before</em> any routes), create a JavaScript array of objects containing an array of songs. Each song should have fields for title, artist, year and chart position. If you need some inspiration, look at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_singles_in_the_United_Kingdom'>this Wikipedia page</a> which lists the biggest selling UK singles of all time (look at "Best-selling singles based on paid-for purchases" to see the songs). You need only include about 5 songs, but try and include two by the same artist. Then, create a <code>topSongs</code> route, which returns the songs to the client as JSON. Again, test it in your browser.</li>
<li><em>More advanced:</em> Modify your <code>artist</code> route to filter the array of songs by the <code>artist</code> parameter passed in, and return the filtered results as JSON, so only songs by that artist are returned to the client.
To do this efficiently in JavaScript, you can use the <code>filter()</code> method which filters an array based on a certain condition. The example below would specifically find all songs called 'Crazy' (note how we convert the requested title to lower case, so we can handle requests containing the word 'Crazy' in either lower case, upper case or a mixture of both): 
<pre>const matchingSongs = allSongs.filter ( song =&gt; song.title.toLowerCase() == 'crazy' );</pre>
</li>
<li>Add an additional route to find all songs in a given date range: 
<pre>/from/:year1/to/:year2</pre>
The route should filter the array to show only those songs released between 
the given years, and again return the results as JSON.
</li>
</ol>
