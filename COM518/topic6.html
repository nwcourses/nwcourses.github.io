<h1>Topic 6: Web Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Leaflet</h1>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Websites and smartphone apps which show maps are very common these days.
Many such sites use commercial mapping providers such as Google Maps and
the like. However, such providers place restrictions on their users
and the maps are often generic and do not show information for specialised
users such as walkers and cyclists.</p>
<p><em>OpenStreetMap</em> is a project to produce free, editable maps of
the entire world. Users can contribute their own mapping data and the
data can be used for free by anyone; see 
<a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'> the OpenStreetMap site</a> for more 
details. Users typically survey a road or path with a GPS device, such as
a smartphone, and then draw the road or path on top of their GPS trace
using editing software.
The fact that the data is free means that developers can use it
for their own pruposes, for instance, create their own maps or develop
routing applications.</p>
<p><em><a href='http://leafletjs.com'>Leaflet</a></em> 
is an open-source JavaScript mapping library which
offers similar functionality to commercial web mapping services such as
Google Maps. It allows you to embed a "slippy" map into a web page.
However, unlike these other services, Leaflet can be used to display 
maps from <em>a whole range</em> of map providers, including, but not 
restricted to, OpenStreetMap.</p>
<h2>Latitude and Longitude</h2>
<p>In order to understand location-based applications, it is important
to understand the coordinate system used on the earth. The most common
coordinate system uses <em>latitude and longitude</em>. Latitude is a measure
of how far north or south you are: the equator is at 0 degrees,
while the North Pole is at 90 degrees North, we are at about 50 and Spain
is at about 40. Longitude is a measure of how far east or west you are:
0 degrees of longitude is referred to as the <em>Prime Meridian</em>
(or <em>Greenwich Meridian</em>) and passes through Greenwich, London. 
By contrast Germany is located
between approximately 7 degrees and 15 degrees East, while New York is at
74 degrees West and the west coast of North America at approximately 120
degrees West.</p>
<p><img src="../images/latlon.png" alt="Latitude and longitude" /></p>
<p>So a given point on the earth can be defined via its latitude and
longitude. We are at, approximately, 50.9 North (latitude) and 1.4 West
(longitude). By convention, latitudes north of the equator and longitudes
east of Greenwich are treated as positive, so we can also define our
position as <strong>longitude -1.4, latitude +50.9</strong>.</p>
<h2>Projections</h2>
<p>An important consideration when doing web mapping is that
<em>the earth is not flat</em> (it's more or less a sphere) while
<em>maps are flat</em>. To display a curved surface on a flat piece
of paper or computer screen, we need to do a <em>projection</em> and
mathematically transform the latitude and longitude to coordinates suitable
for representation on a flat surface. Why is this?
Imagine any printed map of the earth. The map is equal width everywhere, from
far northern areas such as Greenland or north Norway, to the equator. This
does not match reality; since the earth is (more or less) a sphere, 
the circumference of the earth will be much greater at the equator than 
those far northern
areas - indeed, at the poles, the circumference of the earth is zero!</p>
<p>For this reason, latitude and longitude must be transformed
to so called <em>projected coordinates</em> if we want to represent them on
a flat surface, such as a computer screen.  
The details of exactly how this projection is done is 
out of scope of this unit, but it is something to be aware of if you aim
to do more with web mapping. Leaflet makes it easy for us by doing the
transformation automatically.</p>
<p>The most common
projection used with web mapping is informally
referred to as the "Google Projection" (more formally, a type
of <em>Spherical Mercator</em>), so called because Google Maps
popularised it. </p>
<p><img src="../images/projection.png" 
alt="Projecting sphere onto flat surface" /></p>
<h3>Details on the "Google Projection"</h3>
<p>If you are interested, this is how the "Google Projection" works. It
consists of a series of <em>zoom levels</em>, with 0 the most zoomed out and
successive levels progressively zoomed in. How does this work? Basically,
zoom level 0 is defined as a flat map of the entire world, occupying 
256x256 pixels, so that 360 degrees of longitude becomes 256 pixels and 
180 degrees of latitude becomes 256 pixels, as shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/zoom0.png" alt="Google Projection zoom level 0" /><br />
Each successive zoom level zooms in by a factor of 2 in
both directions, so
that at zoom level 1, there are four 256x256 pixel tiles, each covering
a quarter of the earth (N of the equator and W of the Prime Meridian;
N of the equator and E of the Prime Meridian; 
S of the equator and W of the Prime Meridian and
S of the equator and E of the Prime Meridian): 
<br />
<img src="../images/zoom1.png" alt="Google Projection zoom level 1" /><br />
With progressive zoom
levels, we continue zooming in by a factor of 2, so that zoom level 2 has
16 tiles (4x4), zoom level 3 has 64 (8x8), and so on. Each tile has
an x and y coordinate where x=0 represents the leftmost column of tiles,
y=0 represents the topmost row of tiles, and the tile with x=0 y=0 
represents the top left tile (x=1 y=0 represents the second tile on the
top row, and so on)</p>

<h2>Some examples</h2>
<p>We will be using OpenStreetMap as the mapping provider.</p>
<h3>Hello World in Leaflet</h3>
<p>This is a basic example which creates a map. First the JavaScript:
<pre>
const map = L.map ("map1");

const attrib="Map data copyright OpenStreetMap contributors, Open Database Licence";

L.tileLayer
        ("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            { attribution: attrib } ).addTo(map);
            
map.setView([50.908,-1.4], 14);
</pre>
Then the HTML:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Leaflet Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel='stylesheet' href='https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css'/&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Leaflet Test&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id="map1" style="width:800px; height:600px"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='mapapp.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note the following:
    <ul>
    <li>We link in the Leaflet library (a local copy is on Edward2)
    as an external JavaScript file.</li> 
    <li>We also link in the Leaflet CSS file; this is necessary ad
    Leaflet uses some advanced CSS features.</li>
    <li>Note how the HTML contains a <em>div</em> with an ID of <em>map1</em>.
    This will hold our map.</li>
    <li>Moving onto the JavaScript init() function, where we write our
    custom code:
        <ul>
        <li>We first create a map object (the variable <em>map</em>, an object
        of type <em>L.Map</em> created with the <em>L.map()</em> method), 
        and associate it with <em>div1</em>;</li>
        <li>Next we set up a map <em>layer</em>. Leaflet maps consist of
        several <em>layers</em>. This allows us, for instance, to overlay, 
        the locations of points of interest on top of an underlying map.
        Here, the layer is a <em>TileLayer</em>, a layer of map tiles.
        The map tiles come from the server <em>tile.openstreetmap.org</em>.
        The x, y and z in the URL relate to the "Google" tiling scheme,
        see above; z is the zoom level. Leaflet will automatically work
        out the correct values to place in here.</li>
        <li>Having created the layer, we add it to the map
        (<em>addTo(map)</em>).</li>
        <li>Finally, we set the latitude and longitude of the centre of the
        map, here latitude=50.908, longitude=-1.4. We pass the latitude
        and longitude in as a two-member <em>array</em>.</li>
        <li>Note how, when we set the centre of the map, we specify the
        <em>zoom level</em> (see discussion of "Google" tiling scheme,
        above). 13 and 14 are good ones to start with; try
        experimenting with different values.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Adding features</h3>
<p>Most web maps have some kind of <em>overlay</em> on the base map,
for example a series of markers plotting the locations of pubs, cafes or
other points of interest. We can even draw vector shapes (lines, polygons,
circles) and add them to the map. This example creates a map and adds a 
feature to it:
<pre>

const map = L.map ("map1");

const attrib="Map data copyright OpenStreetMap contributors, Open Database Licence";

L.tileLayer
        ("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            { attribution: attrib } ).addTo(map);

const pos = [50.908, -1.4];            
map.setView(pos, 14);

L.marker(pos).addTo(map);
</pre>
</p>
<p>Hopefully this code is obvious. We simply create a marker at the
specified position (<em>L.marker</em> takes an array of two members,
latitude and longitude), and add it to the map.</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>In a mapping application, we commonly need to respond to user 
<em>events</em>, for instance we might want something to happen if the user
clicks on the map (such a display a new marker, for instance) or if the user
finishes dragging the map to a new location 
(we might want to load markers from a server, for instance). It is easy
to attach events in Leaflet, here is an example:
<pre>

const map = L.map ("map1");

const attrib="Map data copyright OpenStreetMap contributors, Open Database Licence";

L.tileLayer
        ("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            { attribution: attrib } ).addTo(map);
            
map.setView([50.908, -1.4], 14);
map.on("click", e =&gt; {
    // "e.latlng" is an object (of type L.LatLng) representing the mouse click 
    // position
    // It has two properties, "lat" is the latitude and "lng" is the longitude.
    alert(`You clicked at:${e.latlng.lat} ${e.latlng.lng}`);
});


</pre>
We use the <em>on()</em> method of the map to attach an event handler to the
map. The <em>on()</em> method takes two parameters: the event type and
the event handler function. A full list of event types can be found on the
<a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html#map-event">
Leaflet website</a>.</p>
<p>In the event-handling function itself (<em>an arrow function</em>), we use
the event object <em>e</em> to obtain details about the event (in this case,
we are interested in the click position). The event object <em>e</em> is
automatically passed to the event handler function by the Leaflet library.
The event object has a <em>latlng</em> property, representing the position
of the mouse click, which is an object of the type <em>L.LatLng</em>. This in 
turn has two properties, <em>lat</em> and <em>lng</em> representing the actual
latitude and longitude.</p>
<h3>Popups</h3>
<p>One commonly-encountered feature of web mapping is <em>popups</em>, in
which the user can click on a marker and be presented with additional 
information on that feature. These are easy to do in Leaflet: we simply
call the <em>bindPopup()</em> method of the feature to attach a popup to
that feature. <em>bindPopup()</em> takes one parameter, the text (you can
include HTML tags) to appear in the popup. Here is an example. 
Note how you have to store the 
marker in a variable so that you can then call bindPopup():
<pre>

const map = L.map ("map1");

const attrib="Map data copyright OpenStreetMap contributors, Open Database Licence";

L.tileLayer
        ("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            { attribution: attrib } ).addTo(map);

const pos = [50.908, -1.4];            
map.setView(pos, 14);

const marker = L.marker(pos).addTo(map);
marker.bindPopup("My Location");
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Circles, polylines and polygons</h3>
<p>The following example shows how to create circle, 
polyline (i.e. a line with multiple points) and polygon features:
<pre>

const map = L.map ("map1");

const attrib="Map data copyright OpenStreetMap contributors, Open Database Licence";

L.tileLayer
        ("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            { attribution: attrib } ).addTo(map);

map.setView([50.908, -1.4], 14);


const solent = L.circle([50.9079, -1.4015], { radius:100}).addTo(map); 


// Saints stadium (football ground)
const saints = L.polygon ( [
        [50.9063 , -1.3914 ] ,
        [50.9063 , -1.3905 ] ,
        [50.9053 , -1.3905 ] ,
        [50.9053 , -1.3914 ]
        ] ).addTo(map);

// Route to railway station
const routeToStation = L.polyline ( [
        [50.9079, -1.4015] ,
        [50.9071, -1.4015], 
        [50.9069, -1.4047],
        [50.9073, -1.4077],
        [50.9081, -1.4134] 
        ]).addTo(map);

solent.bindPopup("Solent University");
saints.bindPopup("Saints stadium");
routeToStation.bindPopup("Route to station");
</pre>
</p>
<p>Again, hopefully this should be mostly self-explanatory. The second
parameter when creating a circle is the radius in metres.
For polygons and polylines, we specify the shape using an array of points.
Each point is a two-member array containing latitude and longitude.</p>
<h3>Styling features</h3>
<p>We can create custom styles for map features. For polygons, circles and
polylines, we can set properties such as the colour and the opacity
(opposite of transparency: 0 is completely transparent and 1 is
completely opaque).</p>
<pre>

const map = L.map ("map1");

const attrib="Map data copyright OpenStreetMap contributors, Open Database Licence";

L.tileLayer
        ("https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
            { attribution: attrib } ).addTo(map);

map.setView([50.908, -1.4], 14);


const solent = L.circle([50.9079, -1.4015], { radius:100, fillColor: 'blue',
                                color: 'red', opacity: 0.5 }).addTo(map); 


// Saints stadium (football ground)
const saints = L.polygon ( [
        [50.9063 , -1.3914 ] ,
        [50.9063 , -1.3905 ] ,
        [50.9053 , -1.3905 ] ,
        [50.9053 , -1.3914 ]
        ] ).addTo(map);

// Route to railway station
const routeToStation = L.polyline ( [
        [50.9079, -1.4015] ,
        [50.9071, -1.4015], 
        [50.9069, -1.4047],
        [50.9073, -1.4077],
        [50.9081, -1.4134] 
        ]).addTo(map);
        
solent.bindPopup("Solent University");
saints.bindPopup("Saints stadium");
routeToStation.bindPopup("Route to station");

</pre>
<p>
In this example, we have set the circle's fill colour (interior colour) to
blue, its outline colour to red, and the opacity to 0.5.</p>
<h2>Displaying markers from a web API</h2>
<p>A common use of web mapping is to show data from a web API on a 
map. For example, we might want to show the location of restaurants in a 
particular city on a web map. This is quite easy - you simply need to make an
AJAX request to a web API, parse the JSON (or XML) returned and create
markers using the data. The following exercise will allow you to explore
this.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>New York is at longitude 74 West, latitude 40.75 North (more or less).
Change the example above so that it's centred on New York, at zoom level 
13.</li>
<li>Find the latitude and longitude of your home town 
(e.g. google it) and change the example
so it's centred on your home town.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add a marker on your map from Exercise 1 on your home town.</li>
<li>Combine the marker and mouse click event examples, above,
so that by clicking on the 
map, you add a marker to the map at that position.
</li>
<li>Using a prompt box to read the text in, bind a popup to the marker 
containing text entered by the user. Use a prompt box to read information in from the user, e.g:
<pre>const text = prompt('Please enter some text');</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise 3 - Connecting to a web API and displaying markers</h3>
<p>This <a href='wadsongs.db'>updated HitTastic! database</a> contains a table called <code>artists</code> which stores the latitude and longitude of the home towns of selected artists, in addition to the <code>wadsongs</code>. Download this, and replace your existing <code>wadsongs.db</code> with it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend your Express server to add an additional route <code>/hometown/:artist</code> which looks up the hometown of a particular artist. It should return
a JSON object containing the hometown name, latitude and longitude, or a 404 if the requested artist cannot be found in the <code>artists</code> table.</li>
<li>Modify your HitTastic! AJAX page (Sessions 3 and 4) so that as well as a 
"Search" button, there is a "Where is this artist from?" button. This should 
connect to a <em>new JavaScript function</em>
which sends an AJAX request to this route. 
 Also modify your code from your AJAX exercise so
that it initialises a Leaflet map. 
</li>
<li>In the AJAX callback, parse the JSON returned so that a 
marker is shown on the map for that artist, and the map is centred at 
the artist's hometown. When the marker is clicked,
the name of the home town of the artist should be shown in a popup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise 4 - adding data to a web API via a map interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a <em>new</em> route to your server, to <em>add</em> a new home town to the database. The route should take, as POST data, the latitude, longitude, artist name, and home town name.</li>
<li> In your client-side code, when the user clicks on the map, send a POST request to this route, containing the required information. Use the map click position for the latitude and longitude, and read the artist name and location via prompt boxes, e.g:
<pre>const artist = prompt('Please enter an artist name');</pre>
</li>
<li>Add a marker to your map <strong>when the response is received from the server, and only if a 200 is returned</strong>.</li>
</ul>
