<h1>Topic 6: Introduction to React</h1>
</div>

<h2>What is React?</h2>
<p>React (see <a href='https://reactjs.org'>reactjs.org</a>)
is a JavaScript framework, originally developed by Facebook, which allows complex JavaScript applications to be written in modular, high-level, easy-to-read code.  React revolves around the concept of a <em>component</em>. A component is a subsection of a web page, consisting of multiple related HTML elements (e.g. &lt;div&gt;s, form fields and buttons), which all work together to perform a particular task.</p>
<p>For example, we could have a component representing a clock, which consists of a &lt;div&gt; containing the current time. Or we could have a component for an AJAX search, consisting of the
text field to enter the search term, the search button and the &lt;div&gt; to display the search results.</p>

<h2 id="creating-your-first-react-app">Creating your first React app</h2>

<p>Formerly, the recommended way of creating a React app was with <a href="https://create-react-app.dev">create-react-app</a>, which automatically downloads dependencies and writes build scripts for you. However <code>create-react-app</code> is no longer maintained and therefore its use is not recommended. It still works, but it may break in the future.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-hello-world-react-app-from-scratch">Creating a Hello World React app from scratch</h3>

<p>Instead, you should create and build it from scratch, making use of <code>npm</code> to install dependencies, Webpack to build, and a third tool, <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a>, which we will look at below.</p>

<p>The Hello World React app configuration is available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/nwcourses/react-starter">https://github.com/nwcourses/react-starter</a>. We will go through each of its components.</p>

<h4 id="babel---transpiling-javascript">Babel - transpiling JavaScript</h4>

<p>Babel is a <em>transpiler</em>: a piece of software which converts between different JavaScript versions. Why is this useful? First of all it allows the newest versions of JavaScript, which may not be supported by older browsers, to be <em>transpiled</em> into older versions which browsers do support. Formerly, Babel was used extensively to transpile ECMAScript 6 upwards into the older version of JavaScript, ECMAScript 5, when the former was not widely supported. Now it is less used for this purpose as ECMAScript 6 and higher are widely supported by browsers.</p>

<p>In the context of React, Babel is important. With React, we write out code using an extension of JavaScript, <em>JSX</em>, which we will look at below. JSX is not natively supported by browsers so we need to transpile it using Babel into standard JavaScript.</p>

<h4 id="the-packagejson">The package.json</h4>

<p>We will start our examination of the starter repository with the <code>package.json</code> file, used by <code>npm</code> to download dependencies and build the app.</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "react-starter",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx webpack"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.23.0",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.22.20",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.22.15",
    "webpack": "^5.88.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.4",
    "babel-loader": "^9.1.3"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Hopefully some of this will be familiar to you from last week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    the <code>scripts</code> section specifies the scripts we can run with <code>npm</code>: you can see there is a <code>build</code> script to build it with Webpack. You can execute this script with:
<pre>npm run build</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    we then specify the <code>devDependencies</code>. They include:
    <ul>
      <li><code>@babel/core</code> : the core part of Babel.</li>
      <li><code>@babel/preset-env</code> : for transpiling ES6 to ES5 (for maximum compatibility the output is in ES5).</li>
      <li><code>@babel/preset-react</code> : for transpiling React JSX code.</li>
      <li><code>webpack</code>, <code>webpack-cli</code> and <code>webpack-dev-server</code>, as last week.</li>
      <li><code>babel-loader</code> : Webpack "plugin" for Babel, linking the two together and allowing you to specify which files will be handled by Babel in <code>webpack.config.js</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally the <code>dependencies</code> include React itself, and <code>react-dom</code> which allows DOM manipulation with React.</p>

<h4 id="the-webpackconfigjs">The webpack.config.js</h4>

<p>Next we will discuss the Webpack configuration file, <code>webpack.config.js</code>, which we also saw last week. Here is the <code>webpack.config.js</code> for this project:</p>

<pre>const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: './public/index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public/dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    optimization: {
        minimize: false
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: "babel-loader"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}</pre>

<p>We went through most of this last week. However note the <code>rules</code> section within <code>module</code>. We looked at this last week in the context of including CSS files and images with Webpack, and specifying custom loaders to handle these and include them in the bundle. Hopefully you can see that this is testing for files with extension <code>.js</code> or <code>.jsx</code>, and if they occur, handle them with the <code>babel-loader</code> (i.e. they will be transpiled with Babel). We also exclude the <code>node_modules</code> folder as we do not want to wastefully run Babel on any third-party libraries we are using, in which the JavaScript will already be suitable for bundling without the use of Babel.</p>

<h4 id="the-babelrc-file">The .babelrc file</h4>

<p>Finally we have a third configuration file: <code>.babelrc</code>. This is the Babel configuration file.</p>
<pre>{
    "presets": ["@babel/env", "@babel/react"]
}</pre>
</p>
<p>This tells Babel which transformations to enable. The <code>env</code> transformation is the standard newer-to-older JavaScript transformation, while the <code>react</code> transformation allows transformation of React (JSX) code into standard JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-react---hello-world">Exploring React - Hello World</h2>

<p>If you look inside the <code>src</code> folder of the <code>react-starter</code> example, you can see <code>index.js</code>, containing a React <code>Hello World</code> application:</p>

<pre>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;);</pre>

<p>If you look at this code, you should notice that the <code>render()</code> method, on the last line, takes a string of HTML which is not in quotes. What is this? Itâ€™s <strong>JSX</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="jsx">JSX</h3>

<p>With React, as hinted above, we use an extension of JavaScript called JSX (see the React documentation). JSX allows us to embed HTML elements within JavaScript code which can simplify coding a component if it contains large amounts of static HTML and only a small amount of variable data. You will see examples of JSX below. Because JSX is not native JavaScript, it needs to be converted to standard JavaScript using Babel. We discussed this process above.</p>

<h3 id="explanation-of-the-code">Explanation of the code</h3>

<p>So what's the code example above doing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First of all we create a root element for our React app. This is done with the <code>createRoot()</code> method, part of <code>ReactDOM</code>. This takes an existing HTML element as an argument - here, the element with the ID of <code>root</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then call the <code>render()</code> method of our root elementand specify something which looks like a string of HTML, but does not have the quotes. This is <strong>JSX</strong>. So here the React code will render an H1 heading reading Hello World inside the element with the ID of <code>root</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
