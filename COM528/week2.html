<h2>Encapsulation</h2>

<p>Object-oriented programming makes use of a technique called <em>encapsulation</em> to control operations on the attributes of a class and prevent unintended errors and data corruption occurring. If we revise last week's Cat class:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        this.weight--;
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
you can see the use of the keywords <code>private</code> and <code>public</code> throughout the code. What do these
mean?
    <ul>
    <li>Any attribute or method preceded by the keyword <code>private</code> can only be used <em>inside the current class</em>.</li>
    <li>Any attribute or method preceded by the keyword <code>public</code> can be used <em>both inside and outside the class</em>.</li>
    </ul>
So you can see that in this example, <em>the methods can be used outside the class</em> but <em>the attributes can only be used inside it.</em>. The <code>main()</code> - repeated below - calls the two <em>methods</em>, <code>walk()</code> and <code>display()</code>, and all references to the <em>attributes</em> are within the methods inside the class.
<pre>
public class CatApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat clyde = new Cat ("Clyde", 2, 5);
        Cat binnie = new Cat ("Binnie", 5, 4);
        
        System.out.println(clyde);
        System.out.println(binnie);
        
        clyde.walk();
        binnie.walk();
        
        System.out.println(clyde);
        System.out.println(binnie);
        
        clyde.walk();
        System.out.println(clyde);
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>This is common practice and is known as <em>encapsulation</em>. Encapsulation means to keep the inner workings of the class hidden from the outside world, and control access to those inner workings
by means of the methods, which act as "gateways" between the outside world and the interior of the class.
</p>
<h4>Use of toString()</h4>
<p>Note that the <code>display()</code> method has been replaced by a <code>toString()</code> method. What does this do? It <em>returns</em> the details of the cat as a String, rather than printing it. Why is that better? It gives more flexibility to the code using the class: it allows the code using the Cat class (<code>CatApp</code> in this case) to choose how to display it, which may not be via <code>System.out.println</code>. For example, a Java web application (which we are looking at later) does not use <code>System.out.println()</code> to display things.</p>
<p>Note also how we are printing the cats directly:
<pre>
System.out.println(clyde);
System.out.println(binnie);
</pre>
When we do this, <code>toString()</code> is used to figure out how to display the cat (or, in general, whatever object we're trying to print).</p>
<p>For the flexibility reason above, <strong>you should in general use <code>toString()</code> rather than trying to write methods which print to the console.</strong>. It allows your code to be used in non-console environments, e.g. web or Android.</p>
<h4>Why perform encapsulation?</h4>
<p>Why is encapsulation performed? Consider this new version of the Cat class:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        if(this.weight &lt;= 5)
        {
            System.out.println("Can't walk any further... the poor cat will be starved!");
        }
        else
        {
            this.weight--;
        }
        
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
This new version includes an <code>if</code> statement inside the <code>walk()</code> method, which prevents the cat
from walking if the weight is 5 or less. Thus we are <em>controlling how the cat's weight can be altered</em> using the walk() method. So if we tried the following in the main():
<pre>
public class EncapsulationApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat sniffy = new Cat ("Sniffy", 5 , 7);
        
        sniffy.walk();
        sniffy.walk();
        
        sniffy.walk();
    }
}
</pre>
The first two calls to <code>walk()</code> would succeed, as the weight would be reduced from 7 to 6 and then from
6 to 5. However the third call to <code>walk()</code> would fail, as the weight would now be 5 and cannot be reduced
any further.</p>
<p>Note how we have <em>used encapsulation to prevent unrealistic things happening</em>. The following code will <em>not compile</em> but <em>only because weight is private</em>:
<pre>
public class NoEncapsulationApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat sniffy = new Cat ("Sniffy", 5 , 7);
    
        sniffy.weight = -1;
    }
}
</pre>
If the weight was not <code>private</code>, you would legitimately be able to set it to -1 from the main() as in the above example. This illustrates the whole concept of encapsulation: <em>to keep the inner workings of a class private and control access from the outside world, to prevent the outside world corrupting it.</em>
</p>
<h3>Accessor and mutator methods</h3>
<p>It is fairly common in object-oriented programming that we wish to access a <em>single attribute</em>, such
as, for example, the name of the cat. We wish to keep this attribute <code>private</code>, so that the outside world
cannot arbitarily change it, but we still wish the outside world to <em>access</em> it. How can we do this?  We can use an <em>accessor method</em>, also referred to as a "getter". Here is a version of the Cat class with
accessor methods for the three attributes:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        if(this.weight &lt;= 5)
        {
            System.out.println("Can't walk any further... poor cat will be starved!");
        }
        else
        {
            this.weight--;
        }
        
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
    
    <em>
    public String getName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
    
    public int getAge()
    {
        return this.age;
    }
    
    public int getWeight()
    {
        return this.weight;
    }
    </em>
}
</pre>
</p>
<h4>Specifying the return types of methods</h4>
<p>Note how these three methods, <code>getName()</code>, <code>getAge()</code> and <code>getWeight()</code>, are 
<em>returning</em> the corresponding attribute. Note also how we <em>specify the return type</em> when writing the method:
<pre>public <em>String</em> getName()</pre>
When writing methods, <em>the return type always immediately precedes the method name.</em> So we are saying that
the <code>getName()</code> method <em>returns</em> a String. Likewise, getAge() and getWeight() both <em>return</em> an int.</p>
<h4>Using the accessor methods from the main()</h4>
<p>The example below shows how we can use the accessor methods in the main() to get individual pieces of 
information about the cat object:
<pre>
public class AccessorsApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat sniffy = new Cat ("Sniffy", 5 , 7);
        Cat tom = new Cat ("Old Tom", 10, 10);
    
        System.out.println (sniffy.getName());
        System.out.println (sniffy.getAge());
        System.out.println (tom.getWeight());
    }
}
</pre>
Note how we use commands such as:
<pre>System.out.println (sniffy.getName());</pre>
What this line is doing is <em>printing the return value of the getName() method</em>, which,
as we can see above, is the <code>name</code> attribute of the Cat object. </p>
<p>This example illustrates how we can use getter methods <em>to provide "read" access to an attribute but
to prevent "write" access.</em> We can obtain the value of the attribute by using the getter method, but we
cannot change its attribute. This is a further example of encapsulation: we allow the outside world to access
the attributes but we do not allow the outside world to arbitrarily change them.</p>
<h4>Mutator methods</h4>
<p>As well as accessor methods, we can also add <em>mutator</em> methods to <em>update</em> attributes. These are also called <em>setter</em> methods because we use them to <em>set</em> data. However, unlike accessors,
they typically have some sort of controls to prevent the data being set to unrealistic values. For example,
a setWeight() method for a Cat would probably prevent the weight being set to less than 0. An example of
such a method is shown below.
<pre>public class Cat
{
    private int weight;
    
    // ...other code omitted...
    
    public void setWeight (int newWeight)
    {
        if(newWeight &gt; 0)
        {
            this.weight = newWeight;
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Cannot set weight to 0 or less.");
        }
    }
}</pre>
</p>



<h2>Passing Parameters to Methods</h2>

<p>
You have already seen in COM411 that you can pass parameters to methods. Here is an enhanced version of <code>Cat</code> showing how you can do this in Java:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk (int distance)
    {
        // Check the weight will be 5 or more after walking that distance
        if(this.weight - distance &lt; 5) 
        {
            System.out.println("The poor cat will be starved if they walk that far!");
        } 
        // If it is, reduce the weight by the distance.
        else 
        {
            this.weight -= distance;
        }
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
Note how the <code>walk()</code> method now takes one parameter, representing the distance walked. Note how, unlike Python, the <em>data type</em> (<code>int</code>) must be declared. We also reduce the weight by the distance. (Note that <code>this.weight -= distance;</code> is a shorter way of writing <code>this.weight = this.weight - distance;</code>; the <code>-=</code> operator reduces a variable by a given value. There are similar <code>+=</code>, <code>*=</code> and <code>/=</code> operators). This could be called in a <code>main()</code> as follows:
<pre>
public class CatAppWithParameters
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat sniffy = new Cat ("Sniffy", 10, 10);
        
        sniffy.walk (5);
        System.out.println(sniffy);
        sniffy.walk (3);
        System.out.println(sniffy);
    }
}
</pre>
Note how we are passing the distance to the walk method. Note the difference between <em>arguments</em> and <em>parameters</em>.  The <em>value passed into a method</em> is called an <em>argument</em>, whereas the <em>parameter</em> is the <em>variable</em> in the method representing that
value. So, here, 5 and 3 are the <em>arguments</em> whereas <code>distance</code> is the <em>parameter</em>.
</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>As you saw last year in COM411, <em>inheritance</em> allows us to use an existing class as a basis for a new, related class.  Imagine we wanted to write classes representing different types of vehicle, e.g. Car, Bus, Motorbike. If we were to write the three classes entirely separately, we'd be <em>repeating</em> a good deal of code - e.g. the code for starting and stopping the engine is common to all three classes.</p>
<p>So what we could do in this case is create a <code>Vehicle</code> class,
containing common functionality for all types of vehicle, and then <em>inherit</em> various <em>subclasses</em> of Vehicle (such as Car, Bus, and
Motorbike) which provide additional functionality specific to that type
of Vehicle. We can say that:
    <ul>
    <li>The Car <em>inherits</em> from or  is a <em>subclass</em> of Vehicle</li>
    <li>Vehicle is a <em>superclass</em> of Car</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>How is inheritance achieved in Java?</h3>
<p>In Java, we use the keyword <code>extends</code>, e.g.
<pre>
public class Car extends Vehicle
{
.... Car attributes and methods
}
</pre>
This means that the <code>Car</code> class inherits from Vehicle. All attributes and methods in Vehicle
will be <em>inherited</em> by Car, so when you create a Car, all the Vehicle methods and attributes
will be available.</p>

<h3>Java Inheritance Example</h3>

<p>Below is a <code>Vehicle</code> superclass with <code>Bike</code> and <code>Car</code>
subclasses.</p>
<h4>Vehicle class (Vehicle.java):</h4>
<pre>
<em>// Generic Vehicle superclass</em>
public class Vehicle 
{
    <em>// Attributes common to all vehicles</em>
    protected int topSpeed, nWheels; 
    protected String make;

    public Vehicle (String makeIn, int topSpeedIn, int nWheelsIn)
    {
        this.make=makeIn;
        this.topSpeed=topSpeedIn;
        this.nWheels=nWheelsIn;
    }

    public void move()
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Moving along...&quot;);
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        return( &quot;Make : &quot; + make + &quot;\nTop speed: &quot; + 
            topSpeed + &quot;\nno. wheels: &quot; + nWheels);
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Car class (Car.java):</h4>
<pre>
public class Car extends Vehicle 
{
    <em>// Car-specific data</em>
    private int engineCapacity; 
    private boolean engineRunning;

    public Car(String makeIn, int topSpeedIn, int engineCapacityIn)
    {
        <em>// Call the superclass (Vehicle) constructor to construct the Vehicle </em>
        <em>// component of the Car. We will pass in the top speed, make, and</em>
        <em>// number of wheels (which we know will be 4)</em>
        super(makeIn, topSpeedIn, 4);

        <em>// Set up the Car-specific attributes (engine capacity)</em>
        this.engineCapacity = engineCapacityIn;
    }

    <em>// Overridden move() for cars</em>
    public void move()
    {
        if (engineRunning)
        {
            System.out.println(&quot;Driving along...&quot;);
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println
                (&quot;Can't drive the car if the engine's stopped!!!&quot;);
        }
    }

    <em>// Car-specific methods</em>
    public void start()
    {
        engineRunning=true;
    }

    public void stop()
    {
        engineRunning = false;
    }

    <em>// Return string representing the car. Note the use of super.toString() to</em>
    <em>// call the superclass (Vehicle) version of toString() to print the</em>
    <em>// make, top speed and number of wheels.</em>
    public String toString() 
    {
        return super.toString() + " Engine running? 
                    &quot; + engineRunning + &quot;\nEngine capacity: &quot; +
                            engineCapacity;
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Bike class (Bike.java):</h4>
<pre>
public class Bike extends Vehicle 
{
    <em>// Bike-specific data</em>
    private boolean isOffRoad;
    private int nGears; 

    public Bike(String makeIn,int topSpeedIn,boolean isOffRoadIn,int nGearsIn)
    {
        <em>//Call the superclass (Vehicle) constructor to construct the Vehicle</em>
        <em>// component of the Bike. We will pass in the top speed, make, and</em>
        <em>// number of wheels (which we know will be 2)</em>
        super(makeIn,topSpeedIn,2);

        <em>// Set up the Bike-specific attributes (off-road status and gears)</em>
        this.isOffRoad = isOffRoadIn;
        this.nGears = nGearsIn;
    }

    public String toString() 
    {
       return super.toString() + &quot; Off road? &quot; + 
                            isOffRoad + &quot;\nNo. Gears: &quot; +
                            nGears;
    }
}

public class InheritanceTestApp 
{
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
        Car c= new Car(&quot;Ford&quot;,120,2000);
        Bike b = new Bike(&quot;Raleigh&quot;,30,true,27);

        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(b);

        c.move();
        c.start();
        c.move();
        c.stop();

        b.move();
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>How is this working?
    <ul>
    <li>First, note that in the <code>Vehicle</code> class the attributes are not private,
    but <em>protected</em>. <em>protected</em> means that attributes are accessible from
    <em>subclasses</em> (e.g. Car, Bike) whereas <code>private</code> indicates that, while the attributes
    are still there in memory, they are hidden from the subclasses and cannot be used from them.</li>
    <li>Note how the constructor for Car calls the Vehicle constructor 
    to initialise the Vehicle aspects of the Car. This is done with the line
    <pre>super(make, topSpeed, 4)</pre>
    The <code>super</code> keyword represents the <em>super</em>class. When used in this way, it means
    "call the superclass constructor". So when the Car constructor is called, it in turn calls the
    Vehicle constructor to initialise the Vehicle aspects of the car (make, top speed, and number of 
    wheels). The Vehicle constructor will initialise the corresponding attributes to the values
    passed to <code>super()</code>: because we always pass 4 for the number of wheels, the
    <code>nWheels</code> attribute will always be initialised to 4 for Cars.</li>
    <li>We do something similar in Bike, but in this case, we always pass 2 for the number of wheels.</li>
    <li>Notice also how we call the superclass version of toString() in the
    subclass version using <code>super.toString()</code></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Overriding Methods</h3>
<p>In the example, Vehicle and Car both have a method called 
<code>move()</code>. We have 
<em>overridden</em> the original version in Vehicle with the version in Car -
in other words, replaced the original Vehicle version of move() with a new 
version in Car.
This will mean that:
    <ul>
    <li>If we call <code>move()</code> on a Vehicle, then the Vehicle 
    <code>move()</code> will be called;</li>
    <li>If we call <code>move()</code> on a Car, then the Car <code>move()</code> 
    will be called;</li>
    <li>If we call <code>move()</code> on a Bike, then the Vehicle <code>move()</code> 
    will be called, because we did not override it in Bike</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>In the same way, <code>toString()</code> is overridden in both Car and Bike. However, unlike for 
<code>move()</code>, the overridden version of <code>toString()</code> calls the original, Vehicle version of
<code>toString()</code> using the super keyword: <code>super.toString();</code>.</p>
<h3>Abstract classes</h3>
<p>You also met <em>abstract classes</em> in COM411. An abstract class is a class that will never be instantiated; it serves only to be the superclass of inherited classes, and to provide common data and methods. Abstract classes typically contain <em>abstract methods</em>, which are methods containing no code; they will be overridden in subclasses. For example we could have an <code>Animal</code> abstract class with a <code>makeNoise()</code> abstract method (as there is no default noise made by a generic Animal!):
<pre>
public <em>abstract</em> class Animal
{
    protected int age, weight;

    public Animal(int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }

    public <em>abstract</em> void makeNoise();
}
</pre>
and then inherit <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code> from it, overriding <code>makeNoise()</code> appropriately. <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code> are <em>concrete</em> classes: classes you can create instances of.
<pre>
public class Cat extends Animal
{
    public Cat(int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        super(ageIn, weightIn);
    }

    public void makeNoise()
    {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}
</pre>
<pre>
public class Dog extends Animal
{
    public Dog(int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        super(ageIn, weightIn);
    }

    public void makeNoise()
    {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Update your Cat project from last week by adding the <code>walk()</code> method from the "Passing parameters to methods" example, above, to your <code>Cat</code> class. Also modify the Cat's <code>eat()</code> method so that the weight can never go above 20. Print a suitable error
message if an attempt is made to increase the weight beyond that amount.</li>

<li>Change the <code>display()</code> method to a <code>toString()</code> method, as in the example above.</li>

<li>Modify your Cat's <code>eat()</code> method further, so that it now takes a parameter of <code>amount</code>.
The weight should increase by the specified amount.</li>

<li>Return to your Student project from last week. Add three simple getter methods, <code>getName()</code>, <code>getCourse()</code> and  <code>getMark()</code> method to your <code>Student</code> class. These should simply return the appropriate attribute.</li>

<li>Change <code>printDetails()</code> to a <code>toString()</code> method which returns the details as a string.</li>

<li>Add a <code>setMark()</code> method to your <code>Student</code> class, to set the student's mark. The method must validate the mark, and check that it is between 0 and 100. The mark should only be updated if it is valid.</li>

<li>Add a <code>getGrade()</code> method to <code>Student</code>. This should return the student's grade as a <code>String</code> based on the mark, according to this scheme :
    <ul>
    <li>70+ : First</li>
    <li>60-69 : 2/1</li>
    <li>50-59 : 2/2</li>
    <li>40-49 : Third</li>
    <li>0-39 : Fail</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Add a <code>didPass()</code> method to <code>Student</code>. This should return a boolean, depending on whether the mark is above or below 40.</li>

<li>Change the <code>Student</code> constructor so that the mark is no longer passed in as a parameter, and instead, set the mark to 0. The idea is that <code>setMark()</code> will be used instead to set the mark later</li>

<li>Replace the <code>printDetails()</code> method with a <code>toString()</code> method.</li>

<li>Test out the above methods by modifying the <code>main()</code> method of your existing program so that:

    <ul>
    <li>After creating each student in the loop, the name and course are printed by calling the <code>getName()</code> and <code>getCourse()</code> methods.</li>
    <li>Then, prompt the user for the mark and read it in from the user with the <code>Scanner</code>. Set the mark using <code>setMark()</code>. Print the student's status (mark, grade, and whether they passed or not) by calling the <code>getMark()</code>, <code>getGrade()</code>, and the <code>didPass()</code> methods, and printing the return value of each.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Create an inheritance hierarchy to represent different types of student. The classes <code>Undergraduate</code> and <code>Masters</code> should extend from <code>Student</code>. Make <code>Student</code> an abstract class and change the <code>getGrade()</code> method of <code>Student</code> to be abstract, and provide overridden versions of <code>getGrade()</code> for <code>Undergraduate</code> and <code>Masters</code>. The undergraduate version should work exactly the same as the version above. The masters version should instead return the following grades:
    <ul>
    <li>70+ : Distinction</li>
    <li>60-69 : Merit</li>
    <li>40-59 : Pass</li>
    <li>0-39 : Fail</li>
    </ul>
Test it by creating a few undergraduate and masters' students in your <code>main()</code>, and printing their grades. You do not need to read them in from the keyboard; you can just hard-code them.
</li>
</ol>
