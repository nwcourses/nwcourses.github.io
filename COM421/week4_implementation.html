<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In week 2 you worked out the logic of stacks and linked lists using <em>pseudocode</em>. Now that you have been introduced to object-oriented programming, you are in a position to actually start coding classes to represent stacks and linked lists.</p>
<h2 id="implementingastackusingaclass">Implementing a Stack using a class</h2>
<p>Having looked at a simple <code>Cat</code> class, we are now going to do something a bit more practical and look at how we might create a <code>Stack</code> class.
Note that it does not actually act as
a stack at the moment, but it provides the framework for how a stack operates;
notice how it contains an array and <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> methods.</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.internalArray = []

    def push(self, item):
        # Code to add an item to the stack will go here

        pass # ends the method when it's empty

    def pop(self):
        # Code to remove an item from the top of the stack will go here 

        pass # ends the method when it's empty

    def __str__(self):
        return self.internalArray.__str__()
</code></pre>
<p>How is this working?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Note how we define three methods again. We have <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> to define the most fundamental operations of a stack. The <code>__init__()</code> method for a stack will, like the cat equivalent, run when the stack is first created. We are using it to create the underlying array associated with the stack (see below for more detail).</p></li>
<li><p>So, going back to <code>__init__()</code>, note how we are attaching an attribute <code>array</code> to the current object, with this code:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="python language-python">self.internalArray = []
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>[]</code> syntax. This creates an empty array. (Well actually, it doesn't; it creates an empty Python <em>list</em>, as we saw last week, but we are treating the list as an array.).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Note how the <code>push()</code> method contains not just <code>self</code> but also another parameter, <code>item</code>. This is the item we want to add to the internal array.</p></li>
<li><p>Note the fourth method, <code>__str__()</code>. This is another special method, rather like <code>__init__()</code>. This is a method which defines <em>how objects of a class are printed</em>. We might want to print our stack with:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="python language-python">print(stack)
</code></pre>
<p>What happens though when we try to print an object? By default we just get its memory address. Adding a <code>__str__()</code> method to a class allows us to return a string representation which can be understood. Here, we return the string representation of the internal array, so when we print the stack, we see the contents of the internal array.</p>
<h3 id="exercise2">Exercise 2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now create a separate program for your Stack. Write the <code>Stack</code> class as shown above, and try and complete the <code>push()</code> method of your <code>Stack</code> so that it takes the value passed to it, and appends it to the internal array. To do this you will need to use the list's <code>append()</code> method. <strong>Use your pseudocode from Week 2 to help you.</strong> Here is a simple example of appending to a list:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">list1 = []
list1.append("John")
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Test your <code>Stack</code> as follows by adding this code <em>below</em> the Stack class:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">stack1 = Stack()
stack1.push(1)
stack1.push(4)
stack1.push(9)
print(stack1)
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Again with the help of your pseudocode from Week 2</strong>, write a <code>pop()</code> method. This should <code>return the last member of the internal array</code> and <code>remove it</code>. How do you do this? It's easier in Python than some other languages as Python features <em>negative indexing</em> in which index -1 always represents the <em>last</em> member of an array or list (and -2 represents the second-to-last, and so on). Try adding this code to your <code>pop()</code> (remember to indent it appropriately!)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">del self.internalArray[-1] # try to delete the last member of the array
return self.internalArray[-1] # and return it so the outside world can access it
</code></pre>
<p>Does this work as you would expect a pop operation to? Test it by adding these lines to your test code (the code where you created the stack and pushed items
onto it), which pops the stack twice and prints the value returned from each <code>pop()</code> operation:</p>
<pre><code class="python language-python">popped1 = stack1.pop()
print(popped1)
popped2 = stack1.pop()
print(popped2)
</code></pre>
<p>You will find it
does not. Why? <strong>Try and fix the code yourself to get it to work!</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Create a <em>second</em> Stack object in your test code, and this time, push these
items onto it:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Linux
Windows
Mac OS X
</code></pre>
<p>Again, print the stack and pop items off the stack. Does it work with strings as well as integers?</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>You need to display an error if you pop an empty stack.
Using an <code>if</code> statement (you are doing these in COM411 this week), display an error message in <code>pop()</code> if the stack is empty.</p>
<p>How can you tell whether the stack is empty? You can use the <code>len()</code> function.  <code>len()</code> gives you the length of an array or list, or string. For example, if
<code>a</code> is an array or list, this <code>if</code> statement will test whether it is empty (has a length of 0).</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">if len(a) == 0:
       print("a is empty")
</code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Create a <code>peek()</code> method for your Stack. Remember a <code>peek</code> operation should
return the top item of the stack <em>without</em> removing it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advanced optional exercise</strong>: If you are coping with this module and COM411 well so far, and keen to do more programming, and want something to do in your own time, read about <em>exceptions</em> and handle the error instead by <em>raising an exception</em>. This would be how errors are handled in real-world implementations of stacks. Feel free to implement your stack using exceptions and send it to me for checking.</p>
<h2 id="implementingalinkedlistusingclasses">Implementing a linked list using classes</h2>
<p>We'll now move on to implementing the other data structure we looked at in week 2 - the linked list - in code. As you may remember, linked lists are a bit more complex than stacks so require a bit more effort to implement. In particular, we will now need <em>two</em> classes,
not one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a <code>Node</code> class to represent an individual node. Each item of data is contained within a <em>node</em>, along with the links to the previous and next item. </p></li>
<li><p>a <code>LinkedList</code> class to represent the linked list as a whole. Remember that
this needs to contain references to the first and last nodes in the linked 
list.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exercise1createanodeclass">Exercise 1: Create a Node class</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a <em>new</em> Repl project. Inside a new file, create a <code>Node</code> class. It should contain an <code>__init__()</code> method which looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">def __init__(self, data):
       self.data = data
       self.prev = None
       self.next = None
</code></pre>
<p>What does this do? Remember we use <code>__init__()</code> to initialise an object of the class. A node needs to contain data. So this <code>__init__()</code> method allows us to create a node, and pass the data to it. The data then gets attached to the current node we're working with, using <code>self.data = data</code>.</p>
<p>Note how we initialise the <code>prev</code> and <code>next</code> attributes to <code>None</code>. These attributes represent the previous and next node. <code>None</code> is a special data type indicating that nothing exists yet; it will be appropriate here as we haven't linked this node to any others yet.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Add a <code>link()</code> method to your Node. This should link another node to the current node. Using the code examples you have seen so far, try to figure out how to pass the new node into the method. Then, link the new node with the current node using this code. Note how it sets the <code>next</code> attribute of the current node to the new node, and the <code>prev</code> attribute of the new node to the current node.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">self.next = newNode 
newNode.prev = self
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Add a <code>__str__()</code> method to Node which returns a string containing the value associated with the node.</p></li>
<li><p>Create some test code which creates two nodes, <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code>, for example;</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">n1 = Node("Fred")
n2 = Node("Tom")
</code></pre>
<p>Note how we pass the data associated with each node ("Fred" and "Tom" here) when we create it. This will call our <code>Node</code> class's <code>__init__()</code> method, and set the variable <code>data</code> equal to whatever was passed in (Fred or Tom).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Now try printing <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> to prove that the nodes have been created separately.</p></li>
<li><p>Now link <code>n2</code> to <code>n1</code>. To prove that the link has worked, try printing out all of these:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>n1.prev
n1.next
n2.prev
n2.next
</code></pre>
<h3 id="exercise2creatingthelinkedlistitself">Exercise 2: Creating the linked list itself</h3>
<p>We have now created our <code>Node</code> class. We are now going to use it in a complete <code>LinkedList</code> class which will allow you to add nodes to a linked list, and access the linked list's first and last members.</p>
<p><em>You can do this exercise in the same file as Exercise 1.</em> </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a LinkedList class. Its <code>__init__()</code> method should initialise two attributes, <code>self.first</code> and <code>self.last</code> to <code>None</code>. (These are the references to the first and last node in the list).</p></li>
<li>Add an <code>add()</code> method to your linked list. This should add a <code>Node</code> to your linked list. <strong>Use the pseudocode from Week 2 to help you.</strong></li>
<li>Add a <code>get()</code> method to your linked list. This should take an index as a parameter, i.e. write it as:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python language-python">def get(self, index):
</code></pre>
<p>and should search the linked list for the node at that index. Having found it, it should return it. <strong>Use your pseudocode from week 2 to help you.</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Test out your linked list by creating three <code>Node</code> objects and adding them to your <code>LinkedList</code>. Once you've added them, try searching for them within the linked list using their index. </p></li>
<li><p>Try searching for an index which does not exist in the linked list, such as index 10 for example. Is the error handled correctly?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More advanced</strong>: Add functionality to insert a new element into the middle of the linked list. The method should take two parameters: the index to insert the data, and the data to be inserted. <strong>Again use your pseudocode from week 2 to help you.</strong></li>
</ol>
