<h2 id="thelinkedlist">The linked list</h2>
<p>We will start with a look at <em>linked lists</em>. Linked lists, which are <em>different to the plain <strong>list</strong>s we discussed above</em>, are unlike arrays
in that they are <em>not</em> stored continuously in memory. Instead, data is stored
as a series of linked <em>nodes</em>. Each node contains one item of data, and links
to the memory locations of the previous and the next item of data in the 
linked list.</p>
<p><img src="images/linkedlist.png" alt="Linked list diagram" /></p>
<p>Each node has a link to the previous and the following node. When we add
a new item of data, we make the previous node link to the new node, and
we link the new node back to the previous node to form a two-way link.</p>
<p>The first node in the list links to nothing in the reverse direction (indicated in Python by the special value <code>None</code>) and similarly, the final node in the list links to nothing in the forward direction.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of this? </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remember how we could use simple arithmetic, using the array index, to 
calculate the location in memory of a given element in an array. Can
we do this here? <strong>We cannot. This is because, in a linked list, items are not 
stored continuously in memory. Instead, each node contains references to the 
memory locations of the previous and the following node.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, <strong>as long as we have a reference to both the start and the end of the linked list, it's efficient to add a new member to the end of the linked list</strong>. We can just create a new node and link it, both ways, to the end node. Contrast this to arrays, in which we had to create a new array with additional space and copy the elements over. We will explore this in more detail in the exercises this week.</p></li>
<li><p>Insertion into the <em>middle</em> of the list has mixed efficiency. On the one hand we have to find the index we want to insert the element at (which as we saw above is inefficient), on the other hand the actual insertion process is easier as we can just break the existing links between the node BEFORE the element we want to insert and the node AFTER this element, and then link in the new element. Again we will look at this in the exercises.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thestack">The stack</h2>
<p>A stack data structure involves adding items from bottom to top, rather like a
stack of plates. When we remove items from the stack, we remove from the top,
again just like a stack of plates.
The stack is known as a "last in first out" or "LIFO" data structure.
It is called this, because the last things we add to the stack, are the
first things we remove. Here is an example of a simple stack of numbers.</p>
<p><img src="images/stack.png" alt="Simple stack" /></p>
<p>A stack can be used for any operation in which we need to navigate back to
a previous state. Examples could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Browser navigation. When we visit a website, we often need to navigate back to a previous site. When we click the 'Back' button, we want to return to the site <em>immediately preceding</em> the one we are currently viewing. So when you click 'Back', the current site might be <em>removed from the stack</em> so that you return to the previous site.</p></li>
<li><p>Directory/folder structure. When navigating the folder system of your computer, you typically start at a 'root' folder (for example <code>C:\</code> on Windows, or your home directory on Linux) and then navigate to subfolders, for example <code>C:\Pictures</code>. You then might navigate to a sub-sub-folder, such as <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday</code> and then <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday\2018</code> and so on. In a subfolder you can navigate upwards to the previous folder, so that if you are in <code>C:\Pictures\Holiday</code> and you navigate upwards, you arrive at <code>C:\Pictures</code> and then <code>C:\</code> if you navigate upwards once more. So the process of navigating upwards <em>removes the current folder from the stack</em> and returns to the previous folder.</p></li>
<li><p>"Undo" commands in desktop applications. Each action you take in a desktop application might be stored on a stack, so that if you select "Undo", the topmost operation would be reversed, and then removed from the stack.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(In actual fact, each of these is now implemented in a slightly more complex way, in the sense that you can, in modern browsers, move both back and forwards along your history, but we are assuming a more simplified implementation in which you can only move back for the purposes of illustrating a stack).</p>
<p>Another use of stacks, which you will appreciate more when you have done more programming, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing function calls in a program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two key operations of a stack, adding and removing items, have special
terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Push</strong>. To <em>push</em> an item onto a stack means to add it to the top.
It is possible the stack may only have a certain capacity, i.e. it can only hold
a certain number of items (perhaps due to memory constraints) in which case an error occurs if the stack is full.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pop</strong>. To <em>pop</em> an item off the stack means to remove it from the top.
The item is removed, and we also obtain it as a result of the pop operation.
If the stack is empty, an error is generated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional operation is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peek</strong>, To <em>peek</em> a stack is to obtain the value of the top-most item of the stack <em>without</em> removing it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exercise4linkedlistpaper">Exercise 1 : Linked List (paper)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Think about what you would have to do to search for a particular
item in a linked list using its index, starting at the beginning. </p>
<p>Draw out a linked list containing the 5 items of data: </p>
<pre><code>- Linux 
- Windows 
- Mac OS X
- Android
- iOS
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine we wish to retrieve the item with index 3 (Android). How could we 
do this? Draw out how you think it could be done on paper, and ask yourself:
<strong>how efficient is this</strong>, particularly compared to doing the same thing with an array. </p></li>
<li>Imagine that we wish to add a new item (Solaris) to the end of the linked list. Draw a diagram showing the process of creating this new item and adding it to the linked list.</li>
</ol>
<!--
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Note how, to find a particular index within a linked list, we have to start at the beginning and follow the links until we arrive at the element we wish to access. This is slow compared to the simple address calculation from an index in an array.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Remember with an array, that we had problems if we wanted to add new data
to the array. We had to create a brand new array with more space, and copy the 
old data into the new array before adding the new data. Think about doing the
same thing with a linked list. On paper, draw a linked list containing the elements </p>
<pre><code>- Linux
- Windows
- Mac OS X
</code></pre>
<p>Now try and add new element "Android" to the end of the linked list. What do you have to do? Draw out what happens on paper.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="solution-1">Solution</h4>
<p>Note how it's easy to add a new element to the end of a linked list. We just need to link it with the current last element, and then update the last element to point to the new element. Compare this with the need to create a new array, and copy the old elements over, if we wish to add elements to an array.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Working out the logic of adding to a linked list</h3>
<p>This exercise allows you to work out the logic of adding to a linked list without (yet) doing any coding.</p>
<p>A linked list has two components: the node, and the linked list itself, as we've seen. Each node is linked in both directions to the previous and the end node.</p>
<p>We need to be able to <em>add a node to a linked list</em>. <strong>What information does the linked list need to store in order to do this efficiently?</strong></p>
<p>Try to write out the logic for adding data to a linked list. You'll need to create a node and add it to the list, but where do you add it? Do you have to do anything different if the list is empty?</li>
<h3 id="exercise5stacks">Exercise 2: Stacks</h3>
<p>We are now going to perform another paper-based exercise with stacks, to help
you understand them and their operations.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an empty stack. Draw the stack after each operation
below, and explain what, if anything is returned from each operation and
any errors that might occur.</p>
<p><code>push (a), push (b), pop (), push (c), peek (), pop (), pop (), pop (), push (d), push (e), push (f), pop (), push (g), push (h), peek (), push (i), pop (), pop (), pop (), peek ().</code></p>
<!--
<h3 id="exercise6linkedlistinsertion">Exercise 4: Linked list insertion</h3>
<p>Think about adding a new item of data into the middle of a linked list. Consider this ordered list of names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Acland</li>
<li>Bonnie Black</li>
<li>Charley Chase</li>
<li>Earl Edwards</li>
<li>Frances Freeman</li>
</ul>
<p>On paper draw these as a linked list. Now try to add "Danielle Dawson" at the appropriate place between "Charley Chase" and "Earl Edwards". What operations need to be done now? Draw them on paper again. Do you think this would be more or less efficient than using an array? </p>
<h4 id="solution-2">Solution</h4>
<p>Note the mixed efficiency when inserting into the middle of the linked list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>on the one hand, we have to search for the name to insert after (i.e. "Charley Chase"). As we have seen above, this is less efficient than arrays if we are searching by index (2 for "Charley Chase"). But if we are searching by name instead, we have to compare each record with the search term ("Charley Chase" here) by starting at the beginning of the data structure and comparing each item in turn to the search term. This is the same process whether we use an array or a linked list, so the efficiency is similar in either case.</p></li>
<li><p>on the other hand, the actual insertion process is <em>more</em> efficient, as we just have to break the links between Charley Chase and Earl Edwards, and create new links between each and Danielle Dawson. This is more efficient than an array, in which we would have to create a new array with one extra space and copy the old items over once again.</p></li>
</ul>
-->
<h3>Exercise: working out the logic of a stack</h3>
<p>Another paper exercise. You need to try and work out how a stack would operate. For the purposes of this exercise, the stack should be implemented internally using an <em>array</em> of a certain fixed length. The array initially contains empty spaces.</p>
<p>What does the stack need to store to keep track of its current top position?</p>
<p>What logic needs to occur when we push an item onto the stack? </p>
<p>What about popping off the stack?</p>
<p>What error checking needs to occur when pushing and popping data?</p>
