<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This week we will continue with our look at algorithms by examining approaches for searching <em>trees</em> (which we did earlier), considering breadth-first search and depth-first-search. This topic will prepare us for looking at graphs in two weeks' time.</p>
<h2 id="treesearching">Tree searching</h2>
<p>We can efficiently search a <em>tree</em> by virtue of its structure. There are two 
general techniques for searching a tree:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Depth-first search</em>. This uses the recursive tree traversal technique we have examined already in <a href="week6.html">Week 6</a>, starting at the root node and then
recursively descending into the child nodes. When the search term is found, we will return it. If the tree is not sorted, we need to keep track of which nodes have been visited and which have not, so we can explore the whole tree. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Breadth-first search</em>. Rather than recursively descending the tree, we
instead we consider each <em>level</em> one at a time. So if we have a tree 
organised as below:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/bfs_tree.png" alt="Example tree for breadth-first search" /></p>
<p>we would first consider node A (the first level), then nodes B and C (the second level), then nodes D, E, F and G (the third level).</p>
<p>Breadth-first search has various applications in route-finding, so by covering it now, we will prepare ourselves for the graphs and route-finding topic in Week 10. </p>
<h3 id="breadthfirstsearch">Breadth-first search</h3>
<p>We will now look at breadth-first search in some detail. It is of note that breadth-first search does <em>not require recursion</em>.</p>
<p>Note the order again in which we consider our nodes: A (the root node) first, followed by B and C (the root's child nodes), followed by D, E, F, and G (the child nodes of B and C).</p>
<p>Our aim is to try and search for a value in the tree. How might we do this?
We check A first, adding it to a collection of nodes to be considered.</p>
<pre><code>[A]
</code></pre>
<p>If A doesn't match, we move on to its child nodes - B and C - and remove A from the collection of nodes to be considered. So, once we've considered and rejected A, the collection will contain B and C.</p>
<pre><code>[B C]
</code></pre>
<p>If B doesn't match, then we know we might need to consider <em>its</em> child nodes (D and E) so we add them to the collection of nodes. Because we are doing a <em>breadth first</em> search, though, and considering the tree "level by level", D and E must be added to the collection of nodes to be searched <em>after</em> C - because when we consider B, we will not have considered C yet, and C is on the same level as B. So after considering B, we remove it fron the collection of nodes to be considered - so we are left with:</p>
<pre><code>[C D E]
</code></pre>
<p>Next we consider C. If C doesn't match, then we know we might need to consider <em>its</em> child nodes (F and G) so we add them to the collection of nodes to be considered. Because we consider each level left-to-right, these should again be added to the collection <em>after</em> D and E. If C doesn't match, again we remove it, so at this stage, the collection of nodes to be considered will be:</p>
<pre><code>[ D E F G ]
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully you can see that it has linear <code>O(n)</code> complexity, dependent on the number of nodes, and thus is not especially efficient when it comes to simple trees. The use of breadth-first search becomes more apparent when we look at graphs; I am introducing the algorithm here so that you understand it when we begin the graphs topic.</p>
<h4 id="whichdatastructuretouseforthenodestobeprocessed">Which data structure to use for the nodes to be processed?</h4>
<p>We use a <em>queue</em> here, because with the breadth-first search, we process the nodes in the order they are added. In other words, the node we add first is the node we process first. We can use the standard library collection <code>collections.deque</code> to do this. A <em>deque</em> is a double-ended queue: a queue which you can add to and remove from both the front and back of. However, here we are just using it as a regular queue.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using a deque as a regular queue. Note how we use <code>append()</code> to add to the deque, and <code>popleft()</code> to remove from it.</p>
<pre><code>import collections

q = collections.deque([])
q.append(123)
q.append(456)
q.append(789)
print(q.popleft())
print(len(q))
</code></pre>
<h3 id="usingtreestostorekeyvaluepairs">Using trees to store key/value pairs</h3>
<p>I have said several times that we test whether each node 'matches'. What exactly do we mean by this? We'd typically use a tree to store and efficiently search for data as an alternative to hash tables. In other words, each node would contain a key/value pair, such as "1smitj01"/"John Smith" for the key and value respectively in a student records system. In Python, this would probably be stored as a tuple (if we didn't want to change the values) or two-member list (if we did). So we could search the tree for a given key (index), and test each node we find in breadth-first (or depth-first) search to see if its key is the key we are searching for. If it is, then we return the value.</p>
<h3 id="binarysearchtreedepthfirst">Binary search tree (depth-first)</h3>
<p>This uses the technique we have seen already to search a tree for a given key (index), namely recursion. We recursively search each successive child node, starting at the root node, until we find the key we are looking for. </p>
<p>For the search to be efficient, we need the tree to be <em>sorted</em>. We have seen already in topic 6 how to add items to a tree in sorted order. The search technique can be considered a specific case of depth-first search in which the tree is sorted and thus we know whether to select the left or right child node, and can ignore the other. For general depth-first search, we cannot guarantee this, and we will need to "backtrack" along branches of the tree to ensure all nodes are visited. In fact depth-first search is a general technique that works on graphs - to be covered in week 10 - as well as trees. As we will see, graphs are usually not sorted in any way.</p>
<p>To search a sorted binary tree we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start at the root node and test that first. Return the value if the key matches.</li>
<li>If the root node key is less than the key we are searching for, descend to the right node, otherwise descend to the left node.</li>
<li>Repeat the process recursively until the key matches; when that happens, return the value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you can see that the complexity is of <code>O(log n)</code> form and it scales well to large values of <code>n</code>, the number of items stored in the tree.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the tree has one level (a root only), we search one node.</li>
<li>If the tree has two levels (three members), we search two nodes.</li>
<li>If the tree has three levels (seven members), we search three nodes.</li>
<li>If the tree has four levels (15 members), we search four nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table below shows the relation between the number of nodes in a sorted and balanced binary tree, and the number of searches. (A <em>balanced</em> tree is one in which the data is evenly added to the left and right sides of the tree. There are techniques for ensuring this, but we will not have time to cover these in this module; I will leave this up to you to research).</p>

<h3 id="exercise1">Exercise 1</h3>
<p>Implement binary search to find if a number is a <em>square number</em> of any number from 1 to 100. You can initialise a list containing all these square numbers using a <em>list comprehension</em> as follows.</p>
<pre><code>numbers = [i*i for i in range(1,101)]
</code></pre>
<p>This code means "fill the list with each value <code>i*i</code> for every value of <code>i</code> in the range 1 to 100" - in other words, the square of every number from 1 to 100, i.e. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, … etc …, up to 10000 (100^2).</p>
<p>The user should input a number to search for. The binary search should search the list using binary search to find out if the number is within the list, and should also print its position within the list.</p>
<p>As for last week, write out the algorithm in <em>pseudocode</em> if you are struggling to create actual code.</p>
<h3 id="exercise2">Exercise 2</h3>
<p>Start with either your own tree from week 6 (if you have completed the week 6 exercise) or the pre-written tree solution at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwcourses/nwcourses.github.io/master/COM421/solutions/tree.py">GitHub</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Implement breadth-first search using the tree (for now return True or False depending on whether the number is in the tree or not).</li>
<li>If you finish question 1, implement a depth-first binary search using the tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, you may find that <em>pseudocode</em> helps you.</p></body></html>
