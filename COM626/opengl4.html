<h1>Mobile Development and 3D Graphics - Part 10</h1>
<h1>OpenGL part 4 - Drawing more complex shapes with vertex indices</h1>
</div>
<h2>PREVIEW! - subject to possible change</h2>
<p>Today we will 
look at drawing more complex shapes made up of individual triangles
by looking at <em>index buffers</em>.</p>


<h2>Drawing more complex shapes: using vertex indices</h2>

<p>So far we have just been drawing single triangles. However in most cases we're interested
in drawing more complex 3D polygons. The key thing is that <em>more complex shapes are made up
of triangles</em>. So we can draw a shape by drawing the individual triangles making up the
shape.</p>

<p>One way of doing this would be to put all vertices of all triangles making up the shape in
a buffer. For example, if we have two triangles making up one face of a box, with vertices at
(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) and (0,1,0) we can divide it into two triangles, with vertices at
(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) for the first triangle and 
(0,0,0) (0,1,0) (1,1,0) for the second triangle. So we could create a buffer with 6 vertices
(2 triangles).</p>
<p>However this is inefficient in terms of memory usage. Our square face contains only
<em>four</em> vertices, while we are using <em>six</em> to draw it (two triangles of three
vertices each). </p>
<p>To deal with this we can use <em>vertex indices</em>. We store each vertex only <em>once</em>
in a buffer and then create another buffer of <em>indices</em> to define how the shapes are
drawn. So for example, to draw our square face we create one buffer with our vertices:
<pre>(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) (0,1,0)</pre>
and then an index buffer containing these values:
<pre>0,1,2, 2,3,0</pre>
The index buffer contains the <em>indices</em> of each vertex that will be drawn, rather than 
the vertex itself. So with the above index buffer, we can see that the first triangle will be
drawn with vertices 0,1 and 2 (ie. (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0)) and the second triangle will be
drawn with vertices 2, 3 and 0 (ie. (1,1,0) (0,1,0) (0,0,0)).</p>
<p>Hopefully it should be obvious that repeating indices is a good deal less wasteful of memory
than repeating the vertices themselves! The indices are typically stored as <em>short ints</em>
(data type <em>short</em>, occupying 2 bytes) whereas a vertex stores three <em>floats</em>, i.e.
it occupies 12 bytes in total.</p>

<p>One thing to bear in mind is that you should define your triangles so that the vertices
are specified in <em>anticlockwise</em> order. If you do not do this, OpenGL will not deal with
hidden faces (i.e. a face which is currently invisible due to being behind another) correctly.</p>

<h3>Setting up an index buffer</h3>

<p>Setting up an index buffer is very similar to setting up a vertex buffer, you create an
array (of <em>short</em>s this time, rather than <em>float</em>s) and create the buffer from
the array:
<pre>
short[] indices = { 0,1,2, 2,3,0 };
ByteBuffer ibuf = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(indices.length*Short.SIZE);
ibuf.order(ByteOrder.nativeOrder());
ibuf.position(0);
ShortBuffer indexbuffer = ibuf.asShortBuffer();
indexbuffer.put(indices);
</pre>
Then, when you draw the shape, you use <em>GLES20.glDrawElements()</em> rather than
<em>GLES20.glDrawArrays()</em>:
<pre>GLES20.glDrawElements(GLES20.GL_TRIANGLES, indices.limit(), GLES20.GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, indices);</pre>
where <em>indices</em> is your index buffer.</p>

<h3>Exercise - creating a box</h3>

<p>You are now going to use indices to create a class to represent a 3D box (cube).
First, add index buffer functionality to your GPUInterface:
	<ul>
	<li>Add a method to your <em>GPUInterface</em> class called
	<em>drawIndexedBufferedData()</em>. This should take four parameters:
	vertices (a Buffer); indices (a Buffer); stride (int) and shader variable (String).
	Use <em>GLES20.glDrawElements()</em> to draw the shape defined by the vertices using
	the indices.</li>
	<li>Test it out by drawing a square with coordinates
	(0,0,-3), (1,0,-3), (1,1,-3), (0,1,-3).</li>
	</ul>
Now create a Box class:
	<ul>
	<li>It should have a constructor taking the x,y
	and z world coordinates of the bottom left of the box.
	In the constructor, create a vertex buffer with these vertices, where
	<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> are the bottom left world coordinates:
		<ul>
		<li>x,y,z</li>
		<li>x+0.5, y, z</li>
		<li>x+0.5, y+0.5, z</li>
		<li>x, y+0.5, z</li>
		<li>x,y,z-0.5</li>
		<li>x+0.5, y, z-0.5</li>
		<li>x+0.5, y+0.5, z-0.5</li>
		<li>x, y+0.5, z-0.5</li>
		</ul>
	Also create an appropriate index buffer to draw all the triangles making up the outer
	faces of the box. Ensure the triangles are drawn anticlockwise!
	Store the vertex and index buffers as attributes of your Box.</li>
	<li>Write a <em>render()</em> method which renders the Box by calling the
	appropriate method of GPUInterface.</li>
	<li>Test it out by drawing two boxes at (0,0,-3) and (0,0,3).
	Colour one red and the other yellow.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Colour buffers</h2>
<p>So far we have coloured the whole of our shapes in one colour.
However, by sending <em>colour buffers</em> (buffers containing colour data) to the shader
we can give <em>each vertex a separate colour</em>. The effect of this will be a "gradient"
effect where the pixels in between each vertex have a blended colour, interpolated from the
vertices and dependent on which vertices
are nearest.</p>
<h3>Shaders using a colour buffer</h3>
<p> Here is an example of a shader which will do this:
<pre>
final String vertexShader =
                "attribute vec4 aVertex, aColour;\n" +
                        "varying vec4 vColour;\n" +
                        "uniform mat4 uPerspMtx, uMvMtx;\n" +
                        "void main(void)\n" +
                        "{\n"+
                        "gl_Position = uPerspMtx * uMvMtx * aVertex;\n" +
                        "vColour = aColour;\n" +
                        "}\n",
                fragmentShader =
                        "precision mediump float;\n" +
                                "varying vec4 vColour;\n" +
                                "void main(void)\n"+
                                "{\n"+
                                "gl_FragColor = vColour;\n" +
                                "}\n";
</pre>
Note how we now have an attribute variable <em>aColour</em> representing the colour of each
vertex. This can be linked to a buffer in the same way that <em>aVertex</em> is linked to 
a buffer of vertices. Note that this is in the vertex shader; this might seem odd as it is
the <em>fragment shader</em> which specifies the colours of pixels making up our shape. However,
<em>we cannot pass attribute variables directly to the fragment shader</em>, due to the 
OpenGL rendering pipeline they must be passed to the vertex shader first. Since the vertex
shader does not deal with colours, we need to <em>pass it on</em> to the fragment shader. To
do this, we store it in a <em>varying</em> variable called <em>vColour</em> (varying variables
are used to pass information from the vertex to the fragment shader) and then
retrieve and use this variable in the fragment shader.</p>

<h3>Passing colour buffers to the shader</h3>

<p>Here is an example of some code to send a colour buffer (as well as vertex and index
buffers) to a shader.
<pre>
int attrVarRef= getShaderVarRef(vertexVar);
int colourVarRef = getShaderVarRef(colourVar);
vertices.position(0);
indices.position(0);
colours.position(0);

GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArray(attrVarRef);
GLES20.glVertexAttribPointer(attrVarRef, 3, GLES20.GL_FLOAT, false, stride, vertices);

GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArray(colourVarRef);
GLES20.glVertexAttribPointer(colourVarRef, 3, GLES20.GL_FLOAT, false, cstride, colours);

GLES20.glDrawElements(GLES20.GL_TRIANGLES, indices.limit(), GLES20.GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, indices);
</pre>
Note how the code to send the colour buffer is exactly the same as that to send the vertex
buffer. Each colour in the colour buffer will correspond to a vertex in the vertex buffer.
We repeat the <em>GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArray()</em> and
<em>GLES20.glVertexAttribPointer()</em> calls for the vertex and buffer data, and then call
<em>GLES20.glDrawElements()</em>.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>Modify your box-drawing application so that the first box has the bottom four vertices
in red and top four in yellow, and the second box has the bottom four vertices in blue and the
top four in green.</p>
