<h1>Mobile Development and 3D Graphics - Part 10</h1>
<h1>OpenGL part 4 - Drawing more complex shapes with vertex indices</h1>
</div>
<p>Today we will 
look at drawing more complex shapes made up of individual triangles
by looking at <em>index buffers</em>.</p>


<h2>Drawing more complex shapes: using vertex indices</h2>

<p>So far we have just been drawing single triangles. However in most cases we're interested
in drawing more complex 3D polygons. The key thing is that <em>more complex shapes are made up
of triangles</em>. So we can draw a shape by drawing the individual triangles making up the
shape.</p>

<p>One way of doing this would be to put all vertices of all triangles making up the shape in a buffer. For example, if we have two triangles making up one face of a cube, with vertices at (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) and (0,1,0) we can divide it into two triangles, with vertices at (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) for the first triangle and (0,0,0) (0,1,0) (1,1,0) for the second triangle. So we could create a buffer with 6 vertices (2 triangles).</p>
<p>However this is inefficient in terms of memory usage. Our square face contains only <em>four</em> vertices, while we are using <em>six</em> to draw it (two triangles of three vertices each). </p>
<p>To deal with this we can use <em>vertex indices</em>. We store each vertex only <em>once</em> in a buffer and then create another buffer of <em>indices</em> to define how the shapes are drawn. So for example, to draw our square face we create one buffer with our vertices:
<pre>(0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) (0,1,0)</pre>
and then an index buffer containing these values:
<pre>0,1,2, 2,3,0</pre>
The index buffer contains the <em>indices</em> of each vertex that will be drawn, rather than the vertex itself. So with the above index buffer, we can see that the first triangle will be drawn with vertices 0,1 and 2 (ie. (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0)) and the second triangle will be drawn with vertices 2, 3 and 0 (ie. (1,1,0) (0,1,0) (0,0,0)).</p>
<p>This is shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/square_index_buffer.png" alt="Index buffers to draw a square" />
</p>
<p>Hopefully it should be obvious that repeating indices is a good deal less wasteful of memory than repeating the vertices themselves! The indices are typically stored as <em>short ints</em> (data type <em>short</em>, occupying 2 bytes) whereas a vertex stores three <em>floats</em>, i.e.
it occupies 12 bytes in total.</p>

<p>One thing to bear in mind is that you should define your triangles so that the vertices are specified in <em>anticlockwise</em> order. In more complex shapes, e.g. cubes, OpenGL uses this to determine which is the front face and which is the back face - the front face will be the one with the coordinates specified in anticlockwise order. You can choose not to show the back face with <em>back face culling</em>. This concept is known as <em>winding order</em>.</p>

<h3>Setting up an index buffer</h3>

<p>Setting up an index buffer is very similar to setting up a vertex buffer, you create an
array (of <em>short</em>s this time, rather than <em>float</em>s) and create the buffer from
the array:
<pre>
val indices = shortArrayOf( 0,1,2, 2,3,0 )
val indexBuffer = OpenGLUtils.makeShortBuffer(indices)
</pre>
Then, when you draw the shape, you use <code>GPUInterface.drawIndexedBufferedData()</code> rather than <code>GPUInterface.drawBufferedTriangles()</code>:
<pre>gpu.drawIndexedBufferedData(vertexBuffer, indexBuffer, stride, ref_aVertex)</pre>
where <code>vertexBuffer</code> is your vertex buffer, <code>indexBuffer</code> your index buffer, <code>stride</code> the stride (see week 7 notes and week 8 lab video), and <code>ref_aVertex</code> is your reference to the vertex attribute shader variable.</p>
<p>Note that we do not need to use <code>GPUInterface.specifyBufferedDataFormat()</code> with <code>GPUInterface.drawIndexedBufferedData()</code> as it's called for us.</p>
<h3>Mixing indexed and non-indexed shapes</h3>

<p>Through multiple calls to <code>GPUInterface.drawIndexedBufferData()</code> and <code>GPUInterface.drawBufferedTriangles()</code> you can mix indexed and non-indexed shapes in the same scene, e.g.:
<pre>gpu.setUniform4FloatArray(ref_uColour, colour1)
gpu.drawIndexedBufferedData(indexedVertexBuffer, indexBuffer, stride, ref_aVertex)

gpu.specifyBufferedDataFormat(ref_aVertex, nonIndexedVertexBuffer, stride)
gpu.setUniform4FloatArray(ref_uColour, colour2)
gpu.drawBufferedTriangles(0, 3)
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 1 - creating a square</h3>

<p>You are now going to use indices to create a class to represent a 3D cube (cube).  First, try setting up a vertex buffer with these coordinates:
<pre>(0,0,-2), (1,0,-2), (1,1,-2), (0,1,-2).</pre>
This is a square made up of two triangles, but four vertices in total. Try drawing the square using vertex indices. Colour it in a different colour to the two triangles (e.g. blue)</p>

<h3>Exercise 2 - creating a cube</h3>

<p>
<img src="../images/cube1.png" alt="Cube" />
</p>

<p>Now you are going to try creating a cube, as shown above, using 8 vertices. The cube has 6 faces, but each face is made up of 2 triangles, so there are 12 triangles in total. So you will need a total of 36 vertex indices in your index buffer, three for each of the 12 triangles.
    <ul>
    <li>Create a <code>Cube</code> class. It should take the x,y and z world coordinates of the bottom left of the cube as parameters. In the <code>init</code> block, create a vertex buffer with these 8 vertices, where <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> are the bottom left world coordinates:
        <ul>
        <li>x, y+0.5, z</li>
        <li>x+0.5, y+0.5, z</li>
        <li>x+0.5, y+0.5, z+0.5</li>
        <li>x, y+0.5, z+0.5</li>
        <li>x, y, z</li>
        <li>x+0.5, y, z</li>
        <li>x+0.5, y, z+0.5</li>
        <li>x, y, z+0.5</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Also create an appropriate index buffer to draw all the triangles making up the outer faces of the cube. Ensure the triangles are drawn anticlockwise! Use the diagram of the cube, above, to help you here, and feel free to sketch out each face of the cube on paper if you feel that will help you. Store the vertex and index buffers as attributes of your Cube.</li>
    <li>Use this to get started:
<pre>class Cube(val x: Float, val y: Float, val z: Float) {
    val vertexBuf: FloatBuffer
    val indexBuf: ShortBuffer

    init {
        // Define your vertices and add them to vertexBuf

        // Define your indices and add them to indexBuf
    }
}
    </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Write a <code>render()</code> method inside the <code>Cube</code> class. This should call <code>GPUInterface.drawIndexedBufferedData()</code> appropriately, using the vertex and index buffers.</li>
    <li>Test it out by drawing two cubes at (3,0,0) and (-3,0,0).
    Colour one red and the other yellow.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Colour buffers</h2>
<p>So far we have coloured the whole of our shapes in one colour.
However, by sending <em>colour buffers</em> (buffers containing colour data) to the shader we can give <em>each vertex a separate colour</em>. The effect of this will be a "gradient" effect where the pixels in between each vertex have a blended colour, interpolated from the vertices and dependent on which vertices
are nearest.</p>
<p>In fact, we would often store vertices and colours in the <em>same buffer</em> for efficiency, as discussed in week 7:
<br />
<img src='../images/stride.png' alt='Vertices and colours in the same buffer' />
</p>
<h3>Shaders using a colour buffer</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a shader which will do this. First the vertex shader:
<pre>
attribute vec4 aVertex, aColour;
varying vec4 vColour;
uniform mat4 uPerspMtx, uMvMtx;
void main(void) {
    gl_Position = uPerspMtx * uMvMtx * aVertex;
    vColour = aColour;
}
</pre>
Then the fragment shader:
<pre>
precision mediump float;
varying vec4 vColour;
void main(void) {
    gl_FragColor = vColour;
}
</pre>
Note how we now have an attribute variable <em>aColour</em> representing the colour of each vertex. This can be linked to a buffer in the same way that <em>aVertex</em> is linked to a buffer of vertices. Note that this is in the vertex shader; this might seem odd as it is the <em>fragment shader</em> which specifies the colours of pixels making up our shape. However, <em>we cannot pass attribute variables directly to the fragment shader</em>, due to the OpenGL rendering pipeline they must be passed to the vertex shader first. Since the vertex shader does not deal with colours, we need to <em>pass it on</em> to the fragment shader. To do this, we store it in a <em>varying</em> variable called <code>vColour</code> (varying variables are used to pass information from the vertex to the fragment shader) and then retrieve and use this variable in the fragment shader.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In recent versions of GLSL, <code>varying</code> variables have been deprecated. However the primary version documented on the Android documentation is still GLSL 1 (used by OpenGL ES 2.0) to maximise device support, as not all devices support newer versions - e.g. see <a href='https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/opengl/draw'>here</a>. Indeed <a href='https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/opengl'>the Android documentation</a> stagtes that OpenGL ES 2.0 (hence GLSL 1) is "the recommended API version to use with current Android devices". So we will continue to use <code>varying</code> variables here as they are part of GLSL 1.</p>

<p><strong>Further note:</strong> From Android 13 there is also the new <em>Android Graphics Shading Language</em>. See <a href='https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/agsl'>here</a>. This is based on GLSL 1 to maximise compatibility, though has some important differences.</p>

<h3>Passing colour buffers to the shader</h3>

<p>Here is an example of some code to send a colour buffer (as well as vertex and index buffers) to a shader. We are going to use a single buffer for both vertices and colours, as introduced in Week 7. 
<pre>
val stride = 24 // because one record contains vertices (12 bytes) and colours (12 bytes)
val attrVarRef= gpu.getAttribLocation("aVertex")
val colourVarRef = gpu.getAttribLocation("aColour")

gpu.specifyBufferedDataFormat(attrVarRef, vertexAndColourBuffer, stride, 0)
gpu.specifyBufferedDataFormat(colourVarRef, vertexAndColourBuffer, stride, 3)
gpu.drawElements(indices)
</pre>

Note how we have two calls to <code>gpu.specifyBufferedDataFormat()</code>, one for the vertices and one for the colours. The stride is set as 24 in both cases, because the gap in bytes between one record (whether that be vertices or colours) is 24 bytes: 3 floats for the vertices, and 3 floats for the colours (6 floats) multiplied by the size of a float in bytes (4).
</p>
<p>To differentiate between the vertices and colours we set the <code>position</code> of the buffer to the appropriate index as a fourth parameter to <code>GPUInterface.specifyBufferedDataFormat().</code> So when the position is 0, we will be pointing at the first vertex, and when the position is 3, we will be pointing at the first colour.</p>

<p>Also note the different way of actually doing the drawing this time, using <code>GPUInterface.drawElements()</code>. This takes an index buffer as an argument and is intended to be called if <code>GPUInterface.specifyBufferedDataFormat()</code> was used rather than <code>GPUInterface.drawIndexedBufferedData()</code>.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p><strong>You'll need to update the OpenGLWrapper library in order to use <code>GPUInterface.drawElements()</code>. Pull the latest version from GitHub, within Android Studio, and build it. Again name the <code>.aar</code> a slightly different name to avoid caching issues.</strong></p>

<p>Modify your cube-drawing application so that the one of the cubes uses different colours for the 8 vertices, e.g: red, yellow, red, yellow for the top 4 vertices and blue, green, blue, green for the bottom 4. You will need to create a new vertex and fragment shader to handle this. Because you are using a different shader program, you will need to create two <code>GPUInterface</code> objects.

<h2>Taking it further - models</h2>
<p>More complex shapes, representing real-world objects, are typically represented by <em>models</em>. These are typically created by specialist modelling software and saved asexternal files containing the vertices and vertex indices (as well as other properties such as textures - to be covered next time). Common model formats include:
<ul>
<li>The <em>Wavefront OBJ</em> format. This is a long-standing format which has been around since at least 1992. When working with the OBJ format, you typically have to deal with: 
    <ul>
    <li>The .obj file itself, containing vertices and faces (defined by indices);</li>
    <li>The <em>.mtl</em> (material) file, describing the properties of the object's surface material, including colour, and any texture which will be applied to it.</li>
    <li>Optional images for textures.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>The <em>glTF</em> format. A more recent format with support for more advanced features, such as animations, and, as described <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/components/gltf-model.html">in the documentation of the A-Frame JavaScript library</a>, information about the scene, such as light sources and cameras. Unlike OBJ, glTF stores the vertex data in a compact binary format, leading to smaller file sizes and faster loading time.</li>
</ul>
We will not have time to cover loading models (which is more difficult in Android compared to web-based OpenGL applications) but is something you might want to do further research on for the assignment.</p>
