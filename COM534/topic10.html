<main>
<h2>Introduction to Database Development with Kotlin</h2>
<p>There are various libraries you can use to persist data in a database within Kotlin. One of the leading libraries is <em><a href='https://jetbrains.github.io/Exposed'>Exposed</a></em>, which was developed by JetBrains, the developers of Kotlin itself. Exposed provides a high level interface to query a database, in which you can write your queries using Kotlin rather than having to write the SQL itself. However the Kotlin queries are still written with SQL semantics, e.g. you include <code>where</code> clauses in your code.</p>
<h2>Introduction to JDBC</h2>
<p>Before we look at Exposed, we are going to take a look at JDBC, because Exposed works with JDBC. JDBC stands for <em>Java Database Connectivity</em> and provides a common standard for connecting to <em>any</em> supported database, such as SQLite, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and so on. The great advantage of JDBC over the "native" methods for connecting to each database is that the same code (either the low-level JDBC API, or a higher-level abstraction such as Exposed) can be used to connect to different databases. The only thing you need to change is the <em>driver</em> and <em>connection</em>.</p>


<h3>JDBC drivers</h3>

<p>JDBC connects to a range of different databases using <em>drivers</em>. Each database has its own driver, and the driver provides the interface between JDBC and the native database. In other words, the driver translates the common interface that JDBC provides into the specific implementation details needed for each type of database. So there is a MySQL driver, an Oracle driver, and so on.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows a typical architecture of a JDBC application, showing the different components and how they interact. Note that not all databases include all layers.
<br />
<img src="../images/jdbc_simplified.png" alt="JDBC simplified" />
<br />
As can be seen, the JDBC API of your application (common to all databases) communicates with the driver. The driver would then typically communicate with a Java API for your specific database (e.g. SQLite) which then may use a native (C or C++) API for that database to actually communicate with the database itself - as most native database APIs are written in C or C++.
</p>

<p>The connection details (the <em>connection string</em>) is different depending on which driver and database are being used. For example:</p>
<pre>jdbc:sqlite:wadsongs.db</pre>
The <code>jdbc:</code> denotes the protocol, which confirms we are using JDBC. The next part of the string is the specific database we are using: <code>sqlite</code> here. The final part of the string is the <code>.db</code> file storing the database. This will be loaded from the main project folder by default.</p>

<h2>Working with Exposed</h2>

<h3>Exposed concepts</h3>

<p>When working with Exposed, you will be using several concepts from the API.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Table</em>. Each database table is represented using an instance of the <code>Table</code> class. When you want to query a given table, you subclass <code>Table</code>, or you can create a <em>singleton object</em> (see below).</li>
<li><em>Transaction</em>. You must perform your database queries within a database <em>transaction</em>, referenced using the <code>Transaction</code> class.</li>
<li><em>Query</em>. You perform your queries using an instance of the <code>Query</code> class. Once the query has been executed, Queries can hold database results, which you can iterate through.</li>
<li><em>ResultRow</em>. Each row returned by a SELECT query is represented by a <code>ResultRow</code>, which you can index to obtain the individual columns</li>
<li><em>Column</em>. A class representing a database column. You use instances of <code>Column</code> to index the <code>ResultRow</code> objects obtained by looping through the database results.</li>
<li><em>Statement</em>. Statements represent a statement that is currently being executed, such as <code>InsertStatement</code> or <code>UpdateStatement</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Exposed's default API is known as the <em>DSL (Domain Specific Language)</em> API. What does this mean? Kotlin allows us to create "meta-languages" for performing specific tasks using very clean and intuitive code, making use of lambda functions extensively. In the case of Exposed, we use a "meta-language" which resembles SQL in its logic, yet uses Kotlin code.</p>
<p>We will look at DSLs in more detail in the Mobile Application Development module. For now, you can find out more <a href='https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html'>in the Kotlin documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Setting up an Exposed project</h3>
<p>You should select Gradle as your build tool when creating a new Exposed project in IntelliJ IDEA:</p>
<p><img src="../images/gradle_project.png" alt="Selecting a Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA" /></p>
<p>You need to specify the Exposed dependencies in the <code>build.gradle.kts</code> file. Replace the existing <code>dependencies</code> block with the following:</p>
<pre>val exposedVersion: String by project
dependencies {
    testImplementation(kotlin("test"))

    implementation("org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc:3.47.0.0")
    implementation("org.jetbrains.exposed:exposed-core:$exposedVersion")
    implementation("org.jetbrains.exposed:exposed-jdbc:$exposedVersion")

}</pre>
<p>and also specify the version of Exposed in <code>gradle.properties</code>:</p>
<pre>exposedVersion=0.56.0</pre>
<p>We have added the <code>core</code> and <code>jdbc</code> sub-modules of Exposed as dependencies, as well as the Xerial SQLite JDBC driver. Once they are added, ensure you sync your <code>build.gradle.kts</code> to download the dependencies by clicking on the resync icon (a small elephant, which is the logo for Gradle, with a "resync" image):</p>
<p><img src="../images/gradle_resync.png" alt="Resyncing build.gradle.kts" /></p>
<h3>Connecting to a database with Exposed</h3>

<p>When connecting to a database with Exposed, you must provide the JDBC <em>connection string</em> and <em>driver</em>, detailed above. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
fun main() {
    Database.connect("jdbc:sqlite:wadsongs.db", "org.sqlite.JDBC")
}
</pre>
<p>Here, <code>jdbc:sqlite:wadsongs.db</code> is the connection string (i.e. we are connecting to an SQLite database named <code>wadsongs.db</code>) and <code>org.sqlite.JDBC</code> is the driver, in this case the Xerial SQLite JDBC driver (the recommended SQLite JDBC driver for Exposed, which we included in our <code>build.gradle.kts</code>).</p>

<h3>Working with tables</h3>

<p>We can either work with an existing table in an existing database or create tables from scratch. In either case, we must work with objects which inherit from the <code>Table</code> class. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.Table

object Wadsongs : Table("wadsongs") {
    val id = integer("id").autoIncrement()
    val title = text("title")
    val artist = text("artist")
    val year = integer("year")
    val downloads = integer("downloads")
    val price = float("price")
    val quantity = integer("quantity")

    override val primaryKey = PrimaryKey(id)
}</pre>
<ul>
<li>First of all note the syntax <pre>object Wadsongs: Table("wadsongs")</pre> This looks like inheritance but we are using <code>object</code>, not <code>class</code>. Why? We are creating a <em>singleton object</em>. A <em>singleton</em> is an object that will only ever have one instance, and is a feature of the <em>singleton pattern</em> (we will look at patterns next week). This makes sense here. We are only working with one database and only one instance of a given table within that database. So rather than creating a <em>class</em> called <code>Wadsongs</code>, we create a single-instance object, or singleton, instead. When we need this object later on, we refer to it by its name, <code>Wadsongs</code>.</li>
<li>As the <code>Wadsongs</code> singleton object inherits from <code>Table</code> with an argument of <code>"wadsongs"</code>, the data will be stored in, and read from, the table <code>wadsongs</code>.</li>
<li>In the body of our <code>Wadsongs</code> object we define a series of attributes representing each column in the database. These are <code>Column</code> objects. Note how we initialise them via methods corresponding to their SQL types, and pass in the column name. Additionally, we mark the <code>id</code> as auto-incrementing by calling the <code>autoIncrement()</code> method.</li>
<li>Note how we specify the primary key. We override the <code>primaryKey</code> attribute of the superclass by creating a <code>PrimaryKey</code> object using the <code>id</code> column. So, <code>id</code> will be the primary key of the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about working with tables in the <a href='https://jetbrains.github.io/Exposed/working-with-tables.html'>official documentation</a>. This includes examples of some topics we will not cover here, such as foreign keys.</p>

<h3>Creating tables</h3>
<p>If our database does not contain the required tables already, we need to create them. We do this with the method <code>SchemaUtils.create</code>, passing our table object in as an argument. For example:</p>
<pre>transaction {
    SchemaUtils.create(Songs)
    SchemaUtils.create(Users)
}</pre>
<p>This creates two tables corresponding to the <code>Songs</code> and <code>Users</code> singleton <code>Table</code> objects. Note how all database queries need to be placed within a <code>transaction</code>. <code>transaction</code> is a function which creates a <code>Transaction</code> object, and executes the given lambda so that <code>this</code> within the lambda refers to the <code>Transaction</code> that has been created. Inside the transaction we create the two tables we need.</p>



<h2>CRUD operations</h2>

<p>CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) describes the standard data operations of creating data, looking up data, updating data and deleting data (in SQL, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE respectively). Here is how we perform CRUD operations with Exposed. You can find out more in <a href='https://jetbrains.github.io/Exposed/dsl-crud-operations.html'>the official documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Retrieval (SELECT statements)</h3>
<p>Here is an example of some code to perform a SELECT statement to find <em>all</em> rows in the table.</p> 
<pre>val results = Wadsongs.selectAll() </pre>
<p><code>selectAll()</code> selects all columns; as it is not followed by anything else, it does a <code>SELECT</code> with no <code>WHERE</code> clause. It returns a <code>Query</code> object which can be looped through : each time we iterate, a new <code>ResultRow</code> will be obtained. So a complete example to display all results might be:</p>
<pre>transaction {
    val results = Wadsongs.selectAll()
    results.forEach {
        println("Title: ${it[Wadsongs.title]}, Artist: ${it[Wadsongs.artist]}")
    }
}</pre>
</pre>
<p>Note how we iterate through the result. In the <code>forEach</code> lambda, <code>it</code> will refer to the current <code>ResultRow</code>. We then use our <code>Column</code> objects to index the <code>ResultRow</code> to find the values in the columns for the current row, and in this example, display them.</p>

<h4>SELECT with a WHERE clause</h4>
<p>Here is an example of a <code>SELECT</code> with a <code>WHERE</code> clause.</p>
<pre>transaction {
    val results = Wadsongs.selectAll().where { Wadsongs.artist.eq(chosenArtist) }</pre>
<p>Note how we chain a <code>where()</code> call onto the results of <code>selectAll()</code>. This takes a lambda as an argument and this lambda should specify how we will will filter the results to find only those which meet a certain condition. Here, we are selecting only those rows where the <code>Wadsongs.artist</code> column has a value equal to (using the <code>eq()</code> method) the artist that the user is searching for, i.e. <code>chosenArtist</code>.</p>

<h4>Infix functions</h4>
<p>We could also write the above example as:</p>
<pre>
transaction {
    val results = Wadsongs.selectAll().where { Wadsongs.artist eq chosenArtist }
}
</pre>
<p>What have we done here? <code>eq</code> is a method, but a special type of method called an <em>infix function</em>. Infix functions (marked with the keyword <code>infix</code>) can be called using a special syntax in which the dot and the parentheses are omitted. This leads to more readable code (note how the second example reads more like a human language construct than the first).</p>
<p>Another example of an infix function is <code>until</code> which returns a Range object representing a range of values up to, but not including, its argument. For example:</p>
<pre>for (i in 1 until 10)</pre> 
<p>loops from 1 to 9. This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>for (i in 1.until(10))</pre> 
<p><code>until</code> is actually an infix function which returns an <code>IntRange</code> object up to, but not including, the argument. Furthermore, note how <code>until()</code> is a method of the constant integer <code>1</code>. This is because, in Kotlin, even primitive types, such as <code>Int</code>, are classes, with their own methods.</p>

<h4>SELECTing specific columns</h4>
<p>We can select specific columns only by using <code>select()</code> rather than <code>selectAll()</code> and passing in a series of arguments consisting of the <code>Column</code> objects we want to select. For example:
</p>
<pre>transaction {
    val results = Wadsongs.select(Wadsongs.title, Wadsongs.artist)
        .where { Wadsongs.artist eq chosenArtist }
}</pre>

<h4>SELECT where only one row is returned</h4>
<p>In cases where only one row is returned you can use the <code>singleOrNull()</code> method of <code>Query</code> to pull out the single row in the results. If no row was returned, <code>null</code> will be returned instead. The return value of <code>singleOrNull()</code> is thus a <em>nullable</em> <code>ResultRow</code>, i.e. <code>ResultRow?</code>.</p>
<pre>val results   = Wadsongs.selectAll()
                .where { Wadsongs.id eq id }.singleOrNull()</pre>
<h3>INSERT statements</h3>
<p>To <code>INSERT</code> a new record you use the <code>insert()</code> method of <code>Table</code>, using your singleton object. This takes a lambda which will be run by the <code>insert()</code> method. In this lambda, <code>it</code> refers to an <code>InsertStatement</code> object which can be indexed by column. So you set the appropriate columns to the values you want to insert:</p>
<pre>
var songId = 0
transaction {
    songId = Wadsongs.insert {
        it[title] = "Getting Away With It"
        it[artist] = "Electronic"
        it[year] = 1989
    }[Wadsongs.id]
}
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>insert()</code> returns the completed <code>InsertStatement</code> object, which will now have the value of the <code>id</code> column filled in. So to access the newly allocated ID, we index this <code>InsertStatement</code> using the <code>Column</code> object <code>Wadsongs.id</code>.</p>

<h3>UPDATE statements</h3>
<p>The pattern for <code>UPDATE</code> statements combines aspects of <code>INSERT</code> and <code>SELECT</code>. You call the <code>update()</code> method of your <code>Table</code> and supply a lambda which performs the update. Inside the lambda, <code>it</code> will refer to an <code>UpdateStatement</code> in which you can set the columns to values in the same way as for <code>INSERT</code>. However, <code>update()</code> needs a <em>condition</em> which specifies the rows which will be updated. For example:</p>
<pre>
var nUpdatedRows = 0
transaction {
    nUpdatedRows = Wadsongs.update({ Wadsongs.artist eq "The Beetles" }) {
        // "it" is an UpdateStatement
        it[artist] = "The Beatles" 
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In this example we find all rows containing the misspelt artist "The Beetles" and updates them to "The Beatles". Note that <code>update()</code> returns the nunber of rows that were updated.</p>
<h3>DELETE statements</h3>
<p><code>DELETE</code> statements are quite easy as we just have to supply a condition. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>var nDeletedRows = 0
transaction {
    nDeletedRows = Wadsongs.deleteWhere { Wadsongs.id eq 123 }
}</pre>
<p>In this example we delete the song where the ID is equal to 123. Similar to <code>update()</code>, <code>deleteWhere()</code> returns the number of rows that were deleted.</p>

<h2>Data Access Objects and Data Entities</h2>
<ul>
<li>When writing object-oriented code to interact with a database or other data source (e.g. a file, or a network data source), we typically make our code easier to read, and thus maintain, by making use of <em>data access objects (DAOs)</em> and <em>data entities</em>. The DAO approach allows you to keep all your database interaction code in one place, keeping the rest of your code "cleaner" and easier to maintain.</li>
<li>What are data entities and data access objects?
    <ul>
    <li>A <em>data entity</em> is a standard Kotlin object representing an individual entity in your table, e.g. a <code>Student</code> object (from the <code>Student</code> class you have already written) representing a record
    in a <code>students</code> table</li>
    <li>A <em>DAO</em> provides an interface to your table as a whole, and
    might contain methods such as <code>findStudentById()</code> or
    <code>findStudentsByName()</code> (for a <code>students</code> table). The methods of the DAO would either return data entities or take them as parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Exposed comes with its own DAO API, however to help you understand the concept of DAOs more clearly, we are going to write our own, using the Exposed DSL API.</strong></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Typically we implement a DAO as an <em><a href='topic6.html'>interface</a></em> which specifies a number of methods which will interact with a data source, and then provide an <em>implementation</em> of that interface for a specific data source. This means that, as the interface defines a series of methods with parameters and return types which will always be present in the DAO, we can easily substitute one data source (e.g. database) with another (e.g. network data source) simply by changing the exact DAO class. The method calls will not need to be changed as they are defined by the interface.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Example of a DAO for the HitTastic! database</h3>
<p>We will implement a DAO as an <em>interface</em> which specifies a number of methods which will interact with a data source, as discussed above.Below is a <code>Song</code> data class and a <code>WadsongsDao</code> interface specifying some typical CRUD operations. Note how the interface has <em>no dependency on Exposed.</em></p>
<pre>
// Data entity
data class Song(var id: Int, val title: String, val artist: String, val year: Int)

// DAO interface
interface WadsongsDao {
    fun insertSong(song: Song) : Int
    fun findAllSongs: List&lt;Song&gt;
    fun findSongById(id:Int) : Song?
    fun updateSong(modifiedSong: Song): Int 
    fun deleteSong(id: Int) : Int
}</pre>
<p>We then provide an <em>implementation</em> for the DAO which supports a specific data source/database API, in this case Exposed:</p>
<pre>
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.*
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.SqlExpressionBuilder.eq
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction

class ExposedWadsongsDao : WadsongsDao {
    override fun insertSong(song: Song) : Int {
        var songId = 0
        transaction {
            songId = Wadsongs.insert {
                it[title] = song.title 
                it[artist] = song.artist 
                it[year] = song.year 
            }[Wadsongs.id]
        }
        song.id = songId // set the provided Song's ID to the ID returned from the INSERT
        return songId
    }

    override fun findAllSongs() : List&lt;Song&gt; {

        var songList = listOf&lt;Song&gt;()
        transaction {
            val results  Wadsongs.selectAll() 
            songList = results.map { Song(
                it[Wadsongs.id], 
                it[Wadsongs.title], 
                it[Wadsongs.artist], 
                it[Wadsongs.year]
            ) }
        }
        return songList
    }

    override fun findSongById(id: Int) : Song? {
        var song: Song? = null
        transaction {
            val resultRow   = Wadsongs.selectAll()
                .where { Wadsongs.id eq id }.singleOrNull()

            resultRow?.apply {
                song = Song(
                    id, 
                    this[Wadsongs.title], 
                    this[Wadsongs.artist], 
                    this[Wadsongs.year]
                )
            }
        }
        return song
    }

    override fun updateSong(modifiedSong: Song): Int {
        var nUpdated = 0
        transaction {
            nUpdated = Wadsongs.update({ Wadsongs.id eq modifiedSong.id }) {
                it[title] = modifiedSong.title
                it[artist] = modifiedSong.artist
                it[year] = modifiedSong.year
            }

        }
        return nUpdated 
    }

    override fun deleteSong(id: Int) : Int{
        var nDeleted = 0
        transaction {
            nDeleted = Wadsongs.deleteWhere { Wadsongs.id eq id }
        }
        return nDeleted 
    }

}
</pre>
</div>

<div>
<h3>DAO - Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Note how the DAO contains a series of methods which perform various
database operations and the data entity (<code>Song</code>) represents an individual song in the database</li>
<li>The rest of our Kotlin code would interface with the DAO, rather than
using the Exposed DSL directly. For example, your other classes would call the DAO's <code>findSongById()</code> method to find a song  using its ID.</li>
<li>Many of the methods contain a <code>Song</code> object as a parameter; the DAO will take this <code>Song</code> object and perform the appropriate operation using the data contained within it
    <ul>
    <li>e.g. the <code>updateSong()</code> method will update the details of
    the song with the ID specified in the song object, to the details
    contained within the song object</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Note this code in the <code>findSongById()</code> method of the DAO:
<pre>
val resultRow = Wadsongs.selectAll()
    .where { Wadsongs.id eq id }.singleOrNull()

resultRow?.apply {
    song = Song(id, 
            this[Wadsongs.title], 
            this[Wadsongs.artist], 
            this[Wadsongs.year]
    )
}
</pre>
As we saw above, <code>singleOrNull()</code> will return either a single row (if one exists) or <code>null</code> (if one doesn't). In this code, if the given ID exists in the database, a row is returned, but if it isn't, <code>null</code> is returned. We then need to create a <code>Song</code> using the <code>ResultRow</code> from the database. However we only want to do this if the <code>ResultRow</code> is not null. An <em>apply block</em> with a null-safety operator (?.) is an elegant way of only performing an operation if the subject of the <code>apply</code> call is not null. It takes a lambda, containing an operation to be performed. Inside this lambda, <code>this</code> will refer to the subject of the <code>apply</code> call (i.e. <code>resultRow</code>). So if <code>resultRow</code> is not null, we will create a <code>Song</code> containing the data from the returned row. Otherwise, the song returned from <code>findSongById()</code> will remain null.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Implement a console-mode Exposed/SQLite CRUD application for your University application. It should make use of the <code>Student</code> class (from previous weeks) and allow the user to:
	<ul>
	<li>Add a new student, specifying name, course and mark. The student ID will be the primary key in the table and should auto-increment.</li>
	<li>Search for students by course</li>
	<li>Search for student by ID, returning <code>null</code> if one cannot be found.</li>
	<li>Delete a student by ID</li>
	<li>Edit a student's details (name, course, mark). The user should enter the student ID and new student details, and then the application should update the details of the student with that ID.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>When you have got this working, modify your code so that it uses a DAO. (If you prefer, you can implement using a DAO from the start).</p>
